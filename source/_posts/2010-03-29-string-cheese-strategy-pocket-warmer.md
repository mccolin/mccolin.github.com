When eating string cheese, I find that I&#8217;m typically looking for a different flavor experience than when I&#8217;m eating regular-old-mozzarella. Not only is string cheese a &#8220;fun&#8221; cheese that I expect to shred apart with my hands, it&#8217;s a different thing altogether.

What I&#8217;m getting at is&#8230; I like my string cheese warm. Not cold like I prefer balls or slices of mozzarella.

How do I get it warm? I&#8217;m glad you asked. My favorite snack-strategy developed at my new job is the string cheese pocket warm-up. It&#8217;s pretty simple:

1.  Grab a string cheese from the fridge
2.  Put it in your pocket (keep it wrapped, please!)
3.  Walk around and talk to a few people.
4.  Get back to work
5.  Then&#8230; remember you have the string cheese in your pocket.
6.  Promptly remove and devour.

Wonderful.
