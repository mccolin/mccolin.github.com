Living on my own in a house with a few other people you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have all sorts of opportunities to cook and prepare food and learn the ins and outs of the kitchen. Preparing new dishes and making old favorites would become a daily happening, yes? No. I tend to work fairly long hours, grab a bite to eat when I can on my way to or from somewhere else, or whip up something that&#8217;s tried and true &#8212; and pretty standard. Occasionally I stray from old standbys by mixing elements of a few together to make something delicious. Here&#8217;s my first foray.

Now this is not groundbreaking stuff. I&#8217;m probably somewhere between the fourteenth and four-hundred-thousandth person to think this one up, but here&#8217;s how I went about it.

**Cheesy Hot Dog Scramble**

Ingredients

*   2 Hot Dogs
*   4 to Six Eggs
*   Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese
*   Fresh Ground Pepper
*   1/2 Tbsp Butter

Preparation

1.  Cut the hot dogs into small pieces (as you would for a wee tot) while sizzling the butter to a melt in a frying pan.
2.  Fry up the hot dog bits on the frying pan, flipping them often enough to prevent burning
3.  While frying up the hot dog bits, whisk four eggs with ground pepper and shredded cheese in a small bowl
4.  Remove the hot dogs from the frying pan, *leaving the resulting grease in the pan*.
5.  Pour the whisked eggs, pepper, and cheese into the pan and prepare as scrambled
6.  When the eggs have coagulated enough, add the hot dog bits and mix all together.

Serves two. Delicious on a toasted sandwich or by its lonesome!
