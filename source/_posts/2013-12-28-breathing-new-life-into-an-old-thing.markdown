So... it turns out I have a personal website. And you are currently reading it. And it also turns
out that I haven't contributed interesting content to this site -- apart from a résumé update or
two -- since my birthday nearly two years ago.

So... I've decided (once again) to put new effort into this place. There are lot of things
going on in my life that are worth talking about -- mostly for my own self reflection purposes, but
no doubt for the benefit of some of you reading. I've used writing and reflection in the past as
a way to deal with change and challenges and that seems like a good thing for me to be doing as
we head into 2014. <!--more-->

What life changes and challenges, you ask!? Well...

 - I'm going to be a dad. [Liz][1] and I are expecting our first child together, due in early
   March of next year. The whole endeavor fills me with joy and excitement, but also questions,
   concerns, and worries.
 - I run [my own solo-employed business][2]. This makes me keen to share thoughts and strategies
   for "businessy" things I'm doing.
 - I'm going to be 31 years old, soon, and that means I'll be undeniably _in my thirties_. This
   means I'm doing lots more "grownup" and "adult" things with my time and my tastes are changing.
   That makes for mildly interesting writing, yes?
 - I'm getting into new things like cooking and organizing and projects and more. I think sharing
   those things about one's self is important.

So, to start, I've redesigned the site (you are currently using your eyeballs to experience that
change) and [I've updated the "About Me" page on this site][3]. It's got new facts, new stories,
and more than before you can learn about me and my life. And beyond that, I'm going to aim to
contribute here more often than I obviously have over the past few years. We'll see if I can keep
up a pace, but the intention is there.
