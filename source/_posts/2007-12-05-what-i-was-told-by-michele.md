Michele is a clairvoyant that I went to last night. Pam and Brian have gone to a weekly session he holds a few times, now, and invited me along. It was really incredible. He teaches for a little while about astrology and other different topics and at the end he reads the people in attendance &#8212; letting them ask questions about themselves, their future, whatever.

I was pretty nervous it being my first time and he started reading me right during his teaching lecture, because he recognized I was new. Maybe it was his way of proving to me that he does have an ability, maybe it&#8217;s something he does to new people to see them squirm a little, or maybe that&#8217;s just what seemed right for him to do at the time. It was ridiculous how accurate he was in describing me without having ever spoken to me before.

Some things he said about me when he called me out during his lecture:

*   He is very introspective, his aura is concentrated around his head
*   Everything is intellectual, he thinks about everything
*   His aura is a dark grey color (this color aura may be why people refer to the &#8220;thinking&#8221; part of the brain as &#8220;grey matter&#8221;)
*   He is calculating and always compiling information
*   All energy is toward microcosmic worlds he creates that are perfect for him. He does not need other people to understand them
*   He is an Aquarius
*   He has sensitive knees; either an existing or future problem with his knees
*   He likes games and is always creating and improving games.
*   He often takes the root of a game and expands upon it, always fixing it.
*   Some ideas about his games and projects he keeps as personal trade secrets
*   He does not like to go ahead with things until the concept is perfectly set in his mind
*   He will have quick bursts and lulls in work because of this
*   He creates very animated worlds in his head, he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;care much for the outside world&#8221;
*   He is aggressive, animated, and edgy

He asked if I had any questions. Being a deer-in-headlights sort of, I only thought to ask one. I asked if my upcoming trip to San Francisco would be a good one:

*   It took you to long to make plans for this trip, so it better be good!
*   You didn&#8217;t make the decision yourself, you were surprised and maybe pushed to do it.
*   You will meet very interesting people and it will be competitive, all about &#8220;who is better than me?&#8221;
*   My guide seems to think it will be &#8220;old San Francisco, not new&#8221;
*   This is in two weeks, yes? (yes, roughly)
*   You will get many ideas that will enhance your creativity
*   It will be a very good trip, have a great time.
*   This place is your Mecca

Kind of rad.

At the end of the session, he goes around and reads each of us. He consults with his guide and tells you what he sees. You can ask questions of him afterward, but I was too chicken to ask some of the things I wanted. He probably knew this. Here are the things he told me:

*   In two years, you will leave New Jersey to live in another part of the country
*   You will do this to flee people. You can be antisocial at times.
*   There will be some feelings of revulsion towards people that you will have and you will leave to reconnect with your self
*   You&#8217;ve been over-thinking things and splitting hairs since you were around seventeen
*   Some split in your family accentuated this when you were nineteen 
    *   *Note: I wasn&#8217;t sure what he was talking about, so he tried to be specific:*
*   It was when you were nineteen, say January 29th.
*   You cannot stay in one place for too long. You will do a lot of jobs, some you may have no idea about, now.
*   You are a perfectionist.
*   Around age 30-31 &#8212; probably 30 &#8212; you will become more stable and maybe settle down

Brian&#8217;s notes also have the final line &#8220;It&#8217;s not a comp,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure if that word expands to &#8220;computer,&#8221; &#8220;competition,&#8221; or something else.

I have some personal-history research to do, because I&#8217;m not sure about everything, but based on his initial reading of me and its crazy kind of accuracy, I&#8217;m willing to bet he knows some things I don&#8217;t know.

Crazy.
