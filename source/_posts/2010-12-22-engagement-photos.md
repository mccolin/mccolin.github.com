Liz and I have, like, the best photographer, ever! We met her at University of Delaware for our engagement photo shoot (11 months after getting engaged! Who says we&#8217;re behind the ball!?) and she made us look seriously beautiful. Well, she didn&#8217;t have to try too hard to make Liz look stunning, but she did manage to make me look fabulous, as well.

Our photographer [featured some of the photos from the session on her blog. Check it out][1].

Makes me look forward to working more with Laurie at [our wedding][3]. Which is coming up in just over three months. Whew!
