Perfect for a warm summer day. Not a salad you&#8217;ve added shrimp to, but a chilled pasta and shrimp sensation! Plus, there&#8217;s mayonnaise, so it&#8217;s extra indulgent&#8230; yes, that&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m going for&#8230; indulgent.

You will need:

*   2 cans of Tiny shrimp (Bumble Bee brand is great, substitute Small if your grocer does not have Tiny)
*   1 lb. box of Medium (or Small) Shell Pasta
*   1 onion (sweet or not, pick your poison)
*   Some celery (no exact amount)
*   Some mayo (again, not exact)
*   Salt, pepper, spices

Take the next 20-30 minutes to prepare, thusly:

1.  Cook pasta. This will take about 20 minutes between bringing the water to a boil and the 12-14 minute cooking time. Which is great, because while it&#8217;s cooking, you&#8230;
2.  Dice the onion and celery. Finely diced is best, but this is an inexact science type of dish, so don&#8217;t sweat it.
3.  When ready, drain the pasta, let it cool a bit (don&#8217;t rinse it, just let it cool in your strainer)
4.  Empty the pasta in a big mixing/salad bowl and add salt and pepper to taste. I also sometimes add oregano or light garlic spices, so play with it a bit. Don&#8217;t over-do it, because next you&#8217;ll&#8230;
5.  Add the diced onions and celery.
6.  Open the cans of shrimp, drain the water from them, and add the shrimp to the bowl and mix everything together with a spatula or wooden spoon.
7.  Add mayo. Add it in rounds, you&#8217;d like your component parts to all have some mayo on them, but by no means be covered in the stuff.
8.  Cover the bowl. Chill for a few hours in the fridge.
9.  Remove from the fridge when cold, give it another few stirs and dish it out.

You can try this with any type of pasta, but the shells are the best, because they occasionally create these shrimp-onion-celery-pasta bombs in one single bite when they catch everything together. It&#8217;s grand.

This makes me think of my Mom. It makes me think of summer. It makes me happy. It&#8217;s a perfect compliment to burgers, hot dogs, and anything else you&#8217;re whipping up on the grill.

Enjoy.
