*I found this in a stack of many things like it &#8212; songs that weren&#8217;t good enough to ever put music to. It&#8217;s from February 2005. I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;Believe Me,&#8221; now, but referred to it as &#8220;Overly Emo Love Song&#8221; at the time. *

I want to show you how much I love you  
If it&#8217;s the only thing I ever do  
If it&#8217;s what you needed to see it  
I&#8217;d rip my heart out and serve it to you

Because life&#8217;s too short to be living in doubt  
Whatever it takes to believe me is what I need now  
So just tell me make me force me show me how  
I can make you see

I can see it in your eyes  
Like every time&#8217;s a surprise  
I tell you that I need you  
You consider it all lies

It&#8217;s the truth and that I know  
So drop the caution and let&#8217;s just go  
Believe me when I tell you truth  
The thing I love most is you

If you want my heart on a platter  
I&#8217;ll bring it to youÂ  with a knife and spoon  
Just on the hope you&#8217;ll believe me  
More than once in a blue moon

Whatever you want me to do  
Whatever you need me to say  
Whatever it takes to convince you  
I can make you see

*Naturally, there&#8217;d be some differentiation between chorus, verses, and breaks. I don&#8217;t think my notes every got that far. It was really interesting to find this. And pretty exciting to tear up the paper it was written on.*
