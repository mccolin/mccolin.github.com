When new people join an organization, company, or group of people, it is the job of the existing folks to bring that new person up-to-speed. During this process, the old-timer has a choice to make regarding their attitude in this indoctrination:

*   &#8220;I love it here and everything is awesome&#8221;
*   &#8220;Things here are cool, but here&#8217;s some sour points&#8221;
*   &#8220;This place sucks&#8221;

When I&#8217;m the old-timer in a scenario like this, I tend to always fall into the second group of people. Why!?

It doesn&#8217;t seem to even matter how I actually feel. If I&#8217;m more honestly in the first or third category, I still pull myself into this category that has mastered the soft touch. I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m putting myself in the new person&#8217;s shoes, because I&#8217;m reevaluating my own personal thinking, or something else.

In a job interview, if someone asks a question such as &#8220;what is the typical project life-cycle like around here?&#8221; &#8212; a very excellent question for an interviewing developer &#8212; I tend to answer at length rather than quickly. &#8220;Typically, the turnover is pretty quick. But some projects can run long because of client delays. It&#8217;s like this one project I&#8217;m on&#8230;. or this other one I&#8217;m working through&#8230;. or this one we had a couple months back&#8230;. yadda yadda&#8230;.&#8221; At a time when I should be upselling and singing the praises of our lifecycle I tend to fall back into this reality-stricken middleground.

This is even true of when I&#8217;m the new guy, too. I always straddle this in-between spot of not getting my expectations up or holding back in my degree of excitement. This has been very noticeable in the past few months as I&#8217;ve met new people and explore new things in San Francisco.

I want to be cordial and friendly and interested, and I temper my highs and lows in order to do this. Maybe this makes me more accurate on the overall. Or maybe this just makes me boring.
