I don&#8217;t get much in the way of traffic on my blog&#8217;s comments, but always have good &#8216;ol Akismet kicking up lots of spam for me. Normally, it&#8217;s your usual, run-of-the-mill, easily-identifiable sex references, but occasionally it&#8217;s kind of mean. Case in point:

> I used to love reading your blog, but lately it’s been a little boring. I’ll still read it though =)

That&#8217;s harsh, spam robot! I&#8217;ve just started up blogging again and here you go knocking down my self-esteem. I suppose my blog *was* more original and interesting for the months upon months that I left it dormant. Now that I&#8217;m wasting your time spewing my thoughts into it, it&#8217;s a little hard to take, right? Sorry &#8217;bout that.
