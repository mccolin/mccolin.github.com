Some things that pop into mind that I think fondly of, but don&#8217;t currently have&#8230;

**I miss driving**. Listening to music possibly too loud while on the way to work. Keeping up with the radio. Just generally controlling my own pace and being able to go beyond the city in which I live. I don&#8217;t miss having to find parking, though.

**I miss thunderstorms.** It rains here, but it&#8217;s that weird, unfulfilling, cold rain. Everyone uses umbrellas they don&#8217;t need and nearly poke out my eye as we pass on the sidewalk. And thunderstorms are just cool. I love watching it pour rain outside from under a porch roof in the summer. The smell. Lots of things.

**I miss hoagies**. You just can&#8217;t get the same thing here. And I want one. Often.

Sigh.
