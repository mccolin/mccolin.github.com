I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is a place where you have as much time to finish projects you start as you need. There, you feel the adequate amount of pressure required to pull off your projects: never so much as to drive you away and never so little as to let you take forever to finish.

You&#8217;d be free to try new things without feeling silly, unless &#8211; of course &#8211; you like feeling silly when you try new things.

Nothing that should be difficult would be easy, but nothing that should be easy would be difficult. Unless there&#8217;s still something to learn from it. Then it can be somewhat difficult.

In heaven, I don&#8217;t think there are any heating bills.
