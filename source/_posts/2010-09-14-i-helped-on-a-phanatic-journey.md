My friends Jess and Dana have been embarking on a journey to photograph themselves with every statue of the Phillie Phanatic that has been across Philadelphia in the recent &#8220;Phanatic About Town&#8221; promotion. Local artists put their own spin on the Phanatic by building themed statues of him. The statues were placed in different locations in the city, and are actually now up for auction.

Jess and Dana wanted a photo of themselves with every Phanatic statue. And, as luck would have it, the Phillies held an event at Citizens Bank Park this past weekend where you could get next to every one of the statues. It&#8217;s kind of cheating, but it works. I helped them take the pictures at the park! And I had a hot dog! It was great!
