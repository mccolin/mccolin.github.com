Liz and I are on our way home for a vacation and visit with family. We haven&#8217;t had a length of time back east since Christmas, so we&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. It&#8217;d be a lie to say were haven&#8217;t been counting down the days for the past two weeks or so.

So you can imagine we were excited to finally be in the air and on our way this morning. We caught a cab at the crack of dawn (or just before ~5:30) this morning and were waiting for takeoff by five after seven. Certainly an early start for both of us. Well, to be accurate a late night for me, since I hadn&#8217;t (and still as of yet have not) slept. I got a new computer and was otherwise wired, so after packing I played on the computer until the wee hours of cab-time.

The flight was terrible. And that&#8217;s even before I consider that the flight didn&#8217;t even take us where we were supposed to go! I&#8217;m typing this entry from a terminal in a Detroit waiting to figure out when we&#8217;ll be back on our way to New Jersey. Sure, there&#8217;s some prickly weather out there, but it&#8217;s sunny here as I type this.

This is my first time in Detroit. I must say, Gate B5 is a charming site. And the moving walkway to my right is pretty exciting. All-in-all, there&#8217;s a lot to see in Detroit even within the fifty foot radius I&#8217;m allowed to stay while I wait for boarding updates.

Sigh.

Rumor has it they&#8217;re getting things together for us. Maybe we \*will\* eventually get home, after all!

Until next time, Detroit!
