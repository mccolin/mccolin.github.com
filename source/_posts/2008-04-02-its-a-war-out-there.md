If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve had the pleasure recently of ticketing your friends, skirting the law, and earning new cars and badges in [Parking Wars][1] for a bit of time, now. *For the record: I&#8217;m nearing $750,000 in the app and am fending off charges from friends of lesser value while trying to climb ever-closer to friends that have more bank.* It&#8217;s addictive, this game!

That&#8217;s why it was fun to see this when I tried to park my cars a bit, just now:

It was maddening, to me, to not be able to move and shift fake cars around on fake streets run virtually by my real friends.

*(All usage figures used below from [Adonomics][2] reports, April 2, 2008) *

When a social networking application can become this addictive and enticing, it&#8217;s a seriously great score. It&#8217;s impressive. There have been studies that say an application &#8212; game or otherwise useful utility &#8212; has somewhere between 30 seconds and one minute to impress (or annoy!) the average Facebook user before they decide to uninstall the application. As most of these applications are attempting to leverage some sort of advertising angle, it&#8217;s a very make-or-break medium.

While I can&#8217;t confirm with numbers that A&E is seeing an uptick in website traffic or viewership for the television program the game is modeled after, I can confirm with numbers that the application itself is proving to be one of the most engaging and actively-used applications in the Facebook realm:

<p class="dataRight">
  Over 90 thousand people use Parking Wars every day. That&#8217;s nearly one-third of all of the 300 thousand plus people that currently have it installed. Somehow, in this realm of shortened attention spans, the folks behind Parking Wars have found a way to get one in every three of their users to return every day!
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  That&#8217;s unheard of. Well, not entirely. Let me give you an idea of how Parking Wars compares to some of the other top applications on Facebook: it ranks #64 in daily engagement (that one-third of people come back every day makes for a very high ranking) and is #498 in total installed user base.
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  While being barely in the top 500 might seem unimpressive, you should realize that being #498 out of #21,848 is a big feat. It&#8217;s right above &#8220;Are You A Bitch,&#8221; right behind &#8220;Which Hollywood Superstar Are You?&#8221; and interestingly close to an application my company has developed &#8211; <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/smartypants/" title="Smarty Pants for Facebook">Smarty Pants</a> (which sits at #518 with 285,000 total users, 8,550 of which come back every day).
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  As companies, advertising agencies, and marketing folk attempt to get a handle on how powerful social networking can be, they should observe applications like Parking Wars. There&#8217;s interesting pulls that keep users checking daily, whether it be defending themselves from ticket-happy friends, attempting to get the most money for their actions (it&#8217;s all virtual dollars, sadly), or just going in a punishing their friends for parking a black car in a yellow cars only zone.
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
   If Parking Wars doesn&#8217;t quite end up driving viewership to their television programming, it at least will go a great distance toward improving their brand image and introducing the A&E brand to the younger demographic available of Facebook. Perhaps in the near future they can find even better ways to pull people like me out of their daily routine to check a social networking application every so often. Good work if they manage it!
