I was born in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, on a Sunday, three weeks before I was expected to arrive, which
is funny to me, because nowadays, I am typically a couple minutes late whenever I'm headed somewhere. 

My family moved to New Jersey when I was very young, and I spent all of my formative years in the Garden 
State. In addition to me, there are lots of amazing things from my home state, like
[football][football], 
[the spaces on the Monopoly board][monopoly],
[the motion picture camera][thomas_edison],
[telephones][bell_labs],
[the better Kevin Smith movies][kevin_smith],
and [Danny freakin' DeVito][devito]! 

I am an only child, which is every bit as great as you thought it'd be when you tried to wish away your
siblings as a kid, but carries with it a lot of additional responsibility. It also means I had a lot of
gently-used board games in my closet growing up, because there weren't brothers or sisters around to
play with. Oh! And the minute detail that if you let your parents down, there's nobody else to pick up
the slack.

**Growing Up...** I was a excellent student in school and I played outside a lot. From a young age, I
created wildly over-detailed sports and game leagues with elaborate rules, rankings, and stats. This 
started simply as "SBF" (Soccer, Baseball Football) on my street in Edison, NJ, then the "Summer Soccer
League" in Branchburg, but grew into things like "Beotch Ball" -- a game played in dorms between two
people with a rule book over five single-spaced pages long, an official world ranking system, and more
than three completed tournaments. This would eventually spur [WOSoMP][wosomp], the Weekend Olympic
Showdown of Massive Proportions in my adult life.

**I attended college** at the [University of Delaware][udel] in Newark, DE, majoring in Computer Science.
To this day, UD is one of my favorite places on earth, and it's where I forged some of my best and 
longest-lasting friendships. Most notably, I met [my future wife][lizza] while attending, but we didn't
become an item until years later. While in school, I was a Resident Assistant my junior and senior years
and followed a passion for that work to a year of grad school as a Hall Director. I also started a band,
called Monica's Ghost, with four of my best friends. We've played two shows ever and that was at least
one too many.

**After school** I moved back home with my parents for a few years as I started my professional life.
I can expound on the benefits and greatness of Central New Jersey for hours, but suburbia can be a bit
less than exciting for a 23 year old post-grad. I made the best of it, learning everything I could at 
my job and trying a few new things like [playing a spy in a local theater production][stalag17] and 
getting that [WOSoMP][wosomp] thing started. 

**After a bit of time...**, I broke out of my comfort zone and **moved to San Francisco** and became
the fourth employee of a startup company. I wanted something different and I wanted to experience living
in a city and there's no reason to *not* do something in your life that feels right, makes sense, and
seems like a great next step. Around the time I put my move in motion, I started a romantic relationship
with my best friend, Liz. We'd been spending a lot of time together over the prior year, and my moving
west was the catalyst for the two of us to admit our feelings for one another and get together. A few
months after I moved, she was able to join me, and we hit the west together. We lived together in San
Francisco for nearly three years. It was an amazing experience, almost like a "second college," at least
socially. We met many friends, tried new things, and forged our romantic relationship.

**We moved back east...** in the summer of 2010. We planned [our wedding][wedding] and settled into an
apartment (and later a house) in Philadelphia. Our time living back east has been enriching. Being closer
to family and our core friend group has yielded many benefits, and we've been able to continue exploring
city life at a lower cost than in SF. While I sometimes miss the west coast, I know I'm where I want to
be and taking the steps I want to take in life.

For those with deeper interest, you might enjoy this list of curious facts about me:
 
 - I am taller than your average dude, but not so much that you'd immediately notice.
 - I broke my left leg jumping out of a swing (and sticking the landing) about three weeks before going to college. Then, during the first week of college I lost a "crutch race" time trial to someone who'd never used crutches before in their life.
 - When I switched school districts as a kid, I didn't get into the gifted and talented program like in my old town on the first try. I'm convinced this is because I said the word "migrate" had something to do with rocks instead of moving, relocation, or birds. It irks me to this day.
 - I had long hair and a ponytail (down to mid back) from fifth through tenth grade. Though it was healthy and by no means a "rat tail," this mullet-in-disguise was probably the worst style decision of my life.
 - In my marriage, I'm the cook and prepare four out of five of our at-home meals. This fact would shock the me from ten or even five years ago.
 - My favorite color was green for my entire childhood and young adult life. Then I switched to orange for no real, discernible reason sometime in college and haven't looked back.
 - I use a special, weird voice when I talk to dogs. Or when a dog walks by on the street. Or when I see a dog. I think they like it.
 - I still think that drawing things out on paper or a dry-erase board first is the best way to visualize it. Web designs. Database architectures. Furniture layouts. Chinese food orders. Anything. It helps me think.
 - The books I've been reading lately are 90% pictures, but my all-time favorite books are probably, in no particular order, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Stranger, In Cold Blood, A Confederacy of Dunces, and The Lottery.
 - I am terrified of (and fascinated by) zombies, sharks, and snakes.
 - I play bass guitar. Sometimes in a band called Monica's Ghost.
 - My mom calls me "bunyip" as a pet name. It's not clear to me whether or not she knew that a Bunyip was a [mythological Australian monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip) at the time she started calling me that.


I have a history of sporadically updating my blog and/or neglecting it for months and years on end. Should you
