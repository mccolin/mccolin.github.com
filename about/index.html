  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was born in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, on a Sunday, three weeks before I was expected to arrive, which
is funny to me, because nowadays, I am typically a couple minutes late whenever I&rsquo;m headed somewhere.</p>

<p>My family moved to New Jersey when I was very young, and I spent all of my formative years in the Garden
State. In addition to me, there are lots of amazing things from my home state, like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1869_college_football_season#First_intercollegiate_football_game_ever_played">football</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">the spaces on the Monopoly board</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">the motion picture camera</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">telephones</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_Askewniverse">the better Kevin Smith movies</a>,
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito">Danny freakin&#8217; DeVito</a>!</p>

<p>I am an only child, which is every bit as great as you thought it&rsquo;d be when you tried to wish away your
siblings as a kid, but carries with it a lot of additional responsibility and it means I had a lot of
gently-used board games in my closet, because there weren&rsquo;t brothers or sisters around to play with.
Oh! And if you let your parents down, there&rsquo;s nobody else to pick up the slack.</p>

<p><strong>Growing Up&hellip;</strong> I was a excellent student in school and I played outside a lot. From a young age, I
created wildly over-detailed sports and game leagues with elaborate rules, rankings, and stats. This
started simply as &ldquo;SBF&rdquo; (Soccer, Baseball Football) on my street in Edison, NJ, then the &ldquo;Summer Soccer
League&rdquo; in Branchburg, but grew into things like &ldquo;Beotch Ball&rdquo; &mdash; a game played in dorms between two
people with a rule book over five single-spaced pages long, an official world ranking system, and more
than three completed tournaments. This would eventually spur <a href="http://wosomp.com/">WOSoMP</a>, the Weekend Olympic
Showdown of Massive Proportions in my adult life.</p>

<p><strong>I attended college</strong> at the <a href="http://udel.edu/">University of Delaware</a> in Newark, DE, majoring in Computer Science.
To this day, UD is one of my favorite places on earth, and it&rsquo;s where I forged some of my best and
longest-lasting friendships. Most notably, I met <a href="http://thebluesunshine.com/">my future wife</a> while attending, but we didn&rsquo;t
become an item until years later. While in school, I was a Resident Assistant my junior and senior years
and followed a passion for that work to a year of grad school as a Hall Director. I also started a band,
called Monica&rsquo;s Ghost, with four of my best friends. We&rsquo;ve played two shows ever and that was at least
one too many.</p>

<p><strong>After school</strong> I moved back home with my parents for a few years as I started my professional life.
I can expound on the benefits and greatness of Central New Jersey for hours, but suburbia can be a bit
less than exciting for a 23 year old post-grad. I made the best of it, learning everything I could at
my job and trying a few new things like <a href="http://www.svptheatre.org/Seasons/2007-40th_season/stalag17pics.htm" title="Hilarios photos of me behind this link">playing a spy in a local theater production</a> and
getting that <a href="http://wosomp.com/">WOSoMP</a> thing started.</p>

<p><strong>After a bit of time&hellip;</strong>, I broke out of my comfort zone and <strong>moved to San Francisco</strong> and became
the fourth employee of a startup company. I wanted something different and I wanted to experience living
in a city and there&rsquo;s no reason to <em>not</em> do something in your life that feels right, makes sense, and
seems like a great next step. Around the time I put my move in motion, I started a romantic relationship
with my best friend, Liz. We&rsquo;d been spending a lot of time together over the prior year, and my moving
west was the catalyst for the two of us to admit our feelings for one another and get together. A few
months after I moved, she was able to join me, and we hit the west together. We lived together in San
Francisco for nearly three years. It was an amazing experience, almost like a &ldquo;second college,&rdquo; at least
socially. We met many friends, tried new things, and forged our romantic relationship.</p>

<p><strong>We moved back east&hellip;</strong> in the summer of 2010. We planned <a href="http://lizandcolin.us/">our wedding</a> and settled into an
apartment (and later a house) in Philadelphia. Our time living back east has been enriching. Being closer
to family and our core friend group has yielded many benefits, and we&rsquo;ve been able to continue exploring
city life at a lower cost than in SF. While I sometimes miss the west coast, I know I&rsquo;m where I want to
be and taking the steps I want to take in life.</p>

<p>For those with deeper interest, you might enjoy this list of curious facts about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am taller than your average dude, but nothing majorly exciting.</li>
<li>I broke my left leg jumping out of a swing (and sticking the landing) about three weeks before going to college.</li>
<li>When I switched school districts as a kid, I didn&rsquo;t get into the gifted and talented program like in my old town on the first try. I&rsquo;m convinced this is because I said the word &ldquo;migrate&rdquo; had something to do with rocks instead of moving, relocation, or birds. It irks me to this day.</li>
<li>I had long hair and a ponytail (down to mid back) from fifth through tenth grade. Though it was healthy and by no means a &ldquo;rat tail,&rdquo; this mullet-in-disguise was probably the worst style decision of my life.</li>
<li>I am not confident that I know how to use a rotary phone. Or operate storm windows.</li>
<li>My favorite foods are all starches. Or covered in cheese. Mmmm&hellip;</li>
<li>My favorite color was green for my entire childhood and young adult life. Then I switched to orange for no real, discernible reason sometime in college and haven&rsquo;t  looked back.</li>
<li>I use a special, weird voice when I talk to dogs. Or when a dog walks by on the street. Or when I see a dog. I think they like it.</li>
<li>I still think that drawing things out on paper or a dry-erase board first is the best way to visualize it. Web designs. Database architectures. Furniture layouts. Chinese food orders. Anything. It helps me think.</li>
<li>The books I&rsquo;ve been reading lately are 90% pictures, but my all-time favorite books are probably, in no particular order, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Stranger, In Cold Blood, One Flew Over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest, and The Lottery.</li>
<li>I am terrified of (and fascinated by) zombies, sharks, and snakes.</li>
<li>I play bass guitar. Sometimes in a band called Monica&rsquo;s Ghost.</li>
<li>My mom calls me &ldquo;bunyip&rdquo; as a pet name. It&rsquo;s not clear to me whether or not she knew that a Bunyip was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip">mythological Australian monster</a> at the time she started calling me that.</li>
</ul>
