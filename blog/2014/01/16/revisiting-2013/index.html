<p>For Liz and I, 2013 was a long and trying year for a number of reasons. At times it seemed
like we were frequently being barraged by funerals for loved ones. At other times, it
seemed we&rsquo;d never be able to make good on some of our plans. And again, it felt like we
were stuck in-between things when we were hoping to move forward.</p>

<p>However, when I look back at the year, turns out there was a lot of awesomeness tucked into
the folds of the calendar. <!--more--></p>

<p>In January, <strong>Liz surprised me for my 30th birthday</strong> by faking
me out with a family dinner that turned into a get together for my entire extended family
and friends:</p>

<p>Her misdirection was party enough: a dinner to one of our favorite restaurants in the city
with my parents, her parents, and brothers and other immediate family. We enjoyed the meal,
the drinks, and the company. Afterward, a few friends were planning to join us for drinks at
a nearby bar, but I didn&rsquo;t really grasp the scope of it until I walked upstairs and there
were over fifty friends and family waiting for me: folks from New York, aunts and uncles,
friends who drove down from Boston, people who&rsquo;d told me they couldn&rsquo;t even make it to hang
out for the weekend, and more. It was a fantastic surprise and I had such a great time.</p>

<p>As winter gave way to spring, Liz and I spruced up our yard and planted greenery on our top
deck and startled settling into our second year living in the Italian Market in Philadelphia.
<a href="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/576767_420889821339432_2020284047_n.jpg">We at delicious food for our friend RA&rsquo;s birthday at Talula&rsquo;s Table in Kennett Square</a>,
and <a href="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/l/t1.0-9/537128_10100974390510514_721067029_n.jpg">we spent a long weekend relaxing in Saint Michael&rsquo;s, MD</a> for our
second anniversary (two years, holy crap!), and generally began peppering our schedule with
a few good times and city outings.</p>

<p><a href="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/576767_420889821339432_2020284047_n.jpg"><img src="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/576767_420889821339432_2020284047_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a>
<a href="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/l/t1.0-9/537128_10100974390510514_721067029_n.jpg"><img src="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/l/t1.0-9/537128_10100974390510514_721067029_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a></p>

<p>Turning things sour, my dear sweet puppy Molly had to be put to sleep. She hadn&rsquo;t been
doing well and my Mom and Dad had been concerned about her health for a few months. Having to
say goodbye to Molly tore my Mom up inside and I will miss her dearly. I&rsquo;ll never forget the
night I came home from a long day of school and activities in HS and Molly was standing in the
living room playing with my Mom &mdash; and I immediately jumped in. She was a great companion to
my Mom through all of the years and was one of the happiest things about visiting home.</p>

<p>Liz&#8217; family dealt with an unkind blow, as well, when her Uncle David surprisingly fell ill and
passed away. It was such a shock to everyone and he&rsquo;s been missed at every family get together
and in-between since. His kindness, fun-loving attitude, and support were traits quickly shared
with others, and though I&rsquo;ve only been with the Hart family for a short while, I knew them well
and will forever miss Uncle Dave&rsquo;s presence at family gatherings.</p>

<p>In an attempt to get 2013 back on a happy track, I returned the favor and <strong>surprised Liz for
her 30th birthday</strong> by inviting her extended family and friends to our house for a late-April
celebration. Our friends Pete and Kerri lured Liz from the house to a huge city fair on Broad
Street while family members snuck into our house, decorated, and got some food and drinks
together. When we returned so Liz could &ldquo;take a nap,&rdquo; everyone pounced on her for a good cheer:</p>

<p><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t1.0-9/321460_440257666069314_702251898_n.jpg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t1.0-9/321460_440257666069314_702251898_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a></p>

<p>Despite not getting her nap, I think Liz enjoyed the surprise and sharing good times with her
nearest and dearest. And now that we&rsquo;ve both finally had surprise parties thrown for us, we
don&rsquo;t have to do it ever again!</p>

<p>In the heart of springtime, I <strong>re-launched
<a href="http://wosomp.com">The Weekend Olympic Showdown of Massive Proportions</a></strong> with great help from
our friends RA and JG. The non-lympics were back with a lot of returning players and a whole
score of new people to get in on the fun. I, personally, was excited to win a few medals, but
was sad to have my team&rsquo;s late charge at victory thwarted by the ever-triumphant red team.</p>

<p><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/62643_443339395761141_69286401_n.jpg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/62643_443339395761141_69286401_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a>
<a href="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t31.0-8/922245_10152797965610603_1800964478_o.jpg"><img src="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t31.0-8/922245_10152797965610603_1800964478_o.jpg" alt="photo" /></a></p>

<p>As expected, people enjoyed themselves thoroughly and I&rsquo;m planning to not wait six and a half
years to throw another one.</p>

<p>Things with <a href="http://awexomelabs.com">Awexome Labs</a> were going strong in the middle of the year,
with major projects booked to companies <a href="http://post-it.com">large</a> and <a href="http://refernow.com">small</a>
and I shook off some rust by running through clouds of color in the Color Me Rad 5K alongside
a handful of good friends.</p>

<p>More to the important points of the year, however, <strong>Liz and I found out we were having a baby</strong>
in June (though we held off on telling family for a while and the Internet for longer). Many of
our friends and family were already on the baby train, and we&rsquo;d been trying to punch a ticket for
a while, and finally jumped aboard.</p>

<p><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/1011754_10101076841338234_1785564138_n.jpg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t1.0-9/1011754_10101076841338234_1785564138_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a>
<a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/1381268_10101271162836394_1819670473_n.jpg"><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/t1.0-9/1381268_10101271162836394_1819670473_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a></p>

<p>Being pregnant for the entire second half of the year sure changed our ability to do a few things,
but we still mananged to travel to California for our friend Cari&rsquo;s spectacular Berkeley wedding
in August, hop a train down to DC together for a conference at Liz&#8217; work in September, and continue
our Homecoming traditions with our Delaware friends in early October. It was a smaller crew than
usual, but Liz and I caught up with the rest of the team when I ran the Marine Corp Marathon 10K
with Pete and Harland at the end of the month. I ran slowly, but completed the race, which is a
win in my book.</p>

<p><a href="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/1385213_10101307478963584_1108169900_n.jpg"><img src="https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/1385213_10101307478963584_1108169900_n.jpg" alt="photo" /></a></p>

<p>As the months turned colder, Liz and I shared in celebrating our nephew Brayden&rsquo;s first Halloween and
his first birthday within a week of one another. He&rsquo;s a crazy little boy that grows every time we
see him and it&rsquo;s been so fun having him in our lives.</p>

<p>Toward the end of November, my Grandmother had a few run-ins with her health and succumbed to her ills
on December 10. I was able to visit her in the hospital and had a surprisingly delightful time with
her, my Mom, and my aunt chatting and joking and telling stories. From what I&rsquo;d been told, I expected
the worst, but Grandmom Ruth was alert, happy, and able when I saw her last and I&rsquo;m thankful for that.
Her funeral was a beautiful blend of classic rites she would have appreciated and an open forum where
those in attendance could share their best memories of her.</p>

<p>As the year steered toward a close, the Christmas holiday was a good bit different from the usual without
Grandmom Ruth in attendance, and our Christmas Day routine had Liz and I up <em>very</em> early and heading
to NJ to unwrap gifts with family. The change in schedule twisted the day up a bit, but spending time
with family was still warming and a great way to relax. We finished the year by joining Liz&#8217; cousins for
a dinner in the city on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and it was 2014 before we knew it.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t readily embark upon another year like 2013 with similar travails, ups and downs, but that
I&rsquo;ve been able to highlight so many positives as well after looking back makes me smile. Here&rsquo;s to 2014,
in which Liz and I will welcome our baby to the world and make a whole mess of new memories!</p>
