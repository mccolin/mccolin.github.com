  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I love dogs. They are both special and awesome. Now, I hate most email forwards, but my aunt sent me a particularly nice one that made me happy, so I figured I&#8217;d post it here:</p>

<p><strong>A Dog&rsquo;s Purpose</strong></p>

<p>Being a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog&#8217;s owners, Ron, his wife Lisa, and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.</p>

<p>I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn&#8217;t do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>As we made arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for six-year-old Shane to observe the procedure. They felt as though Shane might learn something from the experience.</p>

<p>The next day, I felt the familiar catch in my throat as Belker &#8216;s family surrounded him. Shane seemed so calm, petting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. Within a few minutes, Belker slipped peacefully away.</p>

<p>The little boy seemed to accept Belker&#8217;s transition without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a while after Belker&#8217;s Death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives. Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up, &#8216;I know why.&#8217;</p>

<p>Startled, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next stunned me. I&#8217;d never heard a more comforting explanation.</p>

<p>He said, &#8216;People are born so that they can learn how to live a good Life &#8212; like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?&#8217; The Six-year-old continued, &#8216;Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don&#8217;t have to stay as long.</p>

<blockquote><p>Live simply.<br/>
Love generously.<br/>
Care deeply.<br/>
Speak kindly.<br/>
Remember, if a dog was the teacher you would learn things like:<br/>
When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.<br/>
Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure Ecstasy.<br/>
Take naps.<br/>
Stretch before rising.<br/>
Run, romp, and play daily.<br/>
Thrive on attention and let people touch you.<br/>
Avoid biting when a simple growl will do.<br/>
On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.<br/>
On hot days, drink lots of water and lie under a shady tree.<br/>
When you&#8217;re happy, dance around and wag your entire body.<br/>
Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.<br/>
Be loyal.<br/>
Never pretend to be something you&#8217;re not.<br/>
If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.<br/>
When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by, and nuzzle them gently.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aww. Cuuute.</p>
