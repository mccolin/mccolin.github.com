  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It&#8217;s time, my fair readers, to continue our trip down memory lane. Specifically, memories that I don&#8217;t have of films I never saw from 2009. Without any further ado, I present the continuation (and likely the conclusion) of <strong>Movies I Missed from 2009</strong>, picking up where we left off in August:</p>

<p>In related matters, you may want to <a href="http://mccolin.com/blog/2010/02/01/movies-i-missed-from-2009-part-one" title="Before reading the continuation, you should read the beginning">read the first part of this list</a> before continuing. <em>Now</em> let&#8217;s continue:</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Might_Get_Loud">It Might Get Loud</a> &#8211; August</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not normally much of a documentary fan (though a few have sparked and held my interest over the years), but this seemed like a good, old-fashioned, awesome time. Comparing and contrasting the careers of Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge with lots of concert and backstage performance material must&#8217;ve been a blast to film and put together for filmmaker Davis Guggenheim, and I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s a joy to watch and listen to at home. Plans? <strong>Watch on DVD soon</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    This is the 2009 movie that I receive the most flak for not yet having seen. Hands down. I always like a good Tarantino film and was excited for this one&#8217;s release, but never put together a visit to the theater for it. This film has already received its fair share of accolades for its acting, period production, and directing, and will surely be something I snatch up the opportunity to see soon. Plus, my good friend dressed up as Brad Pitt&#8217;s character for Halloween and was appalled I didn&#8217;t pick up on it quickly. Plans? <strong>DVD as soon as I find the time</strong>.

    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fan">Big Fan</a> &#8211; August

  <p>
    Patton Oswalt, normally known for his childish and comedic antics, takes a creepy/sad/dramatic turn here as super fan Paul Aufiero, the self-proclaimed &#8220;biggest NY Giants fan in the world.&#8221; He trades barbs with &#8220;Philadelphia Phil&#8221; over a nightly radio broadcast at night, earning his keep as a parking garage attendant by day. When he and his best friend spot their favorite player while out for the night in Statten Island, they follow him and his entourage to Manhattan, where they&#8217;re accused of being stalkers. Oswalt&#8217;s character is beaten within an inch of his life and now must decide on taking legal/criminal action against the best player on his favorite team while dealing with a wide array of family pressures. This movie flew in under the radar, but I&#8217;ve been bent on seeing it since I first checked out the trailer on Apple&#8217;s site. Plans? <strong>I&#8217;m about halfway through it on Netflix Instant right now.</strong>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract_(film)">Extract</a> &#8211; September</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s about that time. Time for Mike Judge to make another film that splits critics and box offices alike. How could this one miss with Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, JK Simmons, and even Ben Affleck taking turns giving their comedic best? To be perfectly frank, I&#8217;m not even sure what factors move the plot of this movie, but I know that I&#8217;m just more than likely to love anything Judge puts out. Unfortunately for him, I&#8217;m like most everyone else, and won&#8217;t enjoy this one until <strong>DVD</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Informant!">The Informant!</a> &#8211; September</h3>

<p>How was this movie not a huge success!? Matt Damon (who, at this point, is almost always incredible) playing a high-ranking executive turned hilariously bumbling whistle blower already sounds like a farce worth betting on. Plus! Joel McHale plays a pretty decent-sized part. I&#8217;m sold. Still worth tracking down? Yes. And <strong>worth a DVD rental</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invention_of_Lying">The Invention of Lying</a> &#8211; October</h3>

<p>Ricky Gervais movie. Done. But! A movie set in an alternate reality where everyone tells the truth, except for this one dude (Gervais) who schemes a small lie in a quandary over his rent? Seems plausibly weird and fun. <strong>Worth a look once it hits cable</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_It_(film)">Whip It</a> &#8211; October</h3>

<p>So this is a chick flick directed by Drew Barrymore. That sounds like a rough draw, but Ellen Page has stolen movies to success, before, and this just had the feel from its trailers of another good show. A country girl finding her calling in joining a roller derby team that has Kristen Wiig as a member plus as a bonus she has a friend in Maebe Fünke (Alia Shawkat)! Awesome. <strong>May wait for TV or jump on a DVD</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couples_Retreat">Couples Retreat</a> &#8211; October</h3>

<p>I know. The reviews were bad. The trailer was kind of bad. Vince Vaughn was playing the same character he always does. Jon Favreau hasn&#8217;t done much redeeming work since directing <em>Elf</em>. The deck is stacked hard against this one, but I can&#8217;t let the dream that every Jason Bateman movie is gold die. I&#8217;ll have to see for myself, just <strong>maybe not anytime soon</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Education">An Education</a> &#8211; October</h3>

<p>1960&#8242;s coming of age movies are probably the best type of coming of age movies. That this one is British probably helps it in a few key regards. The sexual and relationship patterns in this movie would be a blast for a psychologist to examine, which I think makes this interesting. <strong>I&#8217;ll catch it on TV</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Wild_Things_Are_(film)">Where the Wild Things Are</a> &#8211; October</h3>

<p>It is one of the bigger let downs of my 2009 that I didn&#8217;t make time to see this movie. Everything I&#8217;ve heard is everything you&#8217;ve heard: it&#8217;s a beautiful, poignant, and original take on a cherished children&#8217;s story. They turned 20-or-so pages of illustrated artwork and a few run-on sentences into a full length feature, but didn&#8217;t miss a step. The costumes, scenery, animation, and everything are brilliant. Why didn&#8217;t I skip work to see this one, again!? <strong>Must watch. Quick</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_(film)">Precious</a> &#8211; November</h3>

<p>While October was a pretty good month for movies I missed, gear up for November. <em>Precious</em> starts off the November set with a bang. I think the primary reason I missed this movie is that I was just never set or ready to go see it. It will take a lot out of someone to watch another person be beaten, berated, belittled, and attacked on screen. This is certainly a serious movie with serious material, and word on the street is that it&#8217;s all well done. Mo&#8217;nique is earning favoritism for an Oscar and the star Gabourey Sidibe is fantastic (so say the critics). Sidibe is pretty awesome, too, as she was one of the best guests Conan O&#8217;Brien had this past fall when she was on tour for the movie. <strong>Should see ASAP</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boat_That_Rocked">Pirate Radio</a> &#8211; November</h3>

<p>I didn&#8217;t know this previously, but <em>Pirate Radio</em> is actually <em>The Boat That Rocked</em>, a British import that was re-cut and re-titled for US release after its critical and box office failure overseas. That cuts this movie down a bit for me, but I&#8217;ve got to say they did a bang up job with the trailers. I&#8217;m sad to read that the movie failed commercially and that it wasn&#8217;t well-received, but still think it looks like a good way to spend a couple hours of my time. <strong>I&#8217;ll probably catch it on Netflix</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_(film)">Fantastic Mr. Fox</a> &#8211; November</h3>

<p>As with <em>Coraline</em> before it in 2009, <em>Mr. Fox</em> aims high with its stop-motion animation and starts with absolutely excellent source material from Roald Dahl&#8217;s original childrens&#8217; book. I&#8217;m a sucker for anything Dahl, but am over a barrel to see this movie with the talents of Wes Anderson behind and Clooney, Streep, Murray, and Schwartzman in front of the camera. Well, their voices, at least. Quick fact: Henry Sellick was co-directing with Anderson on this one until the original studio folded and he left to direct <em>Coraline</em>. That there was early project turmoil is not enough to deter me from <strong>getting this on the Netflix queue as soon as its out</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Messenger_(2009_film)">The Messenger</a> &#8211; November</h3>

<p>This movie follows <em>The Hurt Locker</em> on this list in the military epic class, but attacks the effects on personnel back here at home. Ben Foster plays a soldier who is assigned to work with the Army&#8217;s Casualty Notification service upon returning from tours in Iraq. He pairs with a veteran mentor to the task in Woody Harrelson. While struggling with the mission at hand, a love story develops between Foster&#8217;s character a wife he has notified of her husband&#8217;s death. This movie flew under-the-radar a bit, but has earned great acclaim. That Harrelson appeared in this in the same month as <em>Zombieland</em> is wickedly interesting. <strong>Must see when ready</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_(film)">The Road</a> &#8211; November</h3>

<p>Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s novel features life of a man and his son living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic wasteland, scavenging along a great trip south. Along the way, they must avoid cannibals and other obstacles in this dreary life. Viggo Mortensen is a solid actor worth seeing in most anything, and this movie seemed like just the downer of a vehicle to let the dramatic chops fly. I want to see it, but <strong>after reading the book</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_(2009_film)">Brothers</a> &#8211; December</h3>

<p>I saw a trailer for this one night and was immediately hooked. To have Tobey Maguire, of all actors, in the incredibly creepy tormented brother role is a nice twist. Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are excellent actors, as well, rounding out the core of a talented cast. In this movie, a family that has moved on after their father (Maguire) goes missing and is pronounced dead in Iraq, hears news that their father is alive and returning home. His wife (Portman) and brother (Gylenhaal) have bonded in the time since he has left and his return dismantles the family that had learned to cope with his loss. Seems like it could have been a tear-jerker, but they crafted it into a psychological thriller&#8230; or I&#8217;m misreading its advertisements. Either way, I&#8217;m in for a <strong>quick Netflix catchup</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Heart">Crazy Heart</a> &#8211; December</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be totally serious with you on this one. It&#8217;s getting rave reviews and there is Oscar talk abounding for the music and movie. And the main character is The Dude, perhaps better known to most as Jeff Bridges. Having recently re-watched <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, I&#8217;m all in for <em>Crazy Heart</em>, however incomparable those two films are. <strong>DVD only if I can&#8217;t get to a theater soon enough</strong></p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)">Avatar</a> &#8211; December</h3>

<p>I have *very* mixed feelings about this one. I really had little interest in seeing it. I thought it was going to be stupid and had a heavily recycled plot and maybe too many special effects and not enough substance. Those things may all be true, but the movie has grossed over $2bil and people are still going crazy over it. I&#8217;ve heard (and believe) it must be seen in the theater in 3D, and that&#8217;s probably what I&#8217;ll buckle down and do. I mean, it&#8217;s not going anywhere anytime soon. Verdict? <strong>Theater probably</strong>, if not &#8212; then what?</p>

<p>And that about does it. That&#8217;s my list of Movies I Missed from 2009 &#8212; the movies I wanted to see, but didn&#8217;t get around to for one reason or another. Stay tuned this week for more movie-related list geekery and let me know if you agree, disagree, or have advice for anything based on my list by commenting.</p>
