    Today, I captured all of the contents of articles that were submitted to my favorite website from ten years ago and tucked them behind a locked door. I am, of course, speaking of **[fatDOG][1]**, the personal website of mine that exploded into an online journal featuring more than 30 authors when I took my first public foray into data-backed website development.

One could almost draw a straight line from the technical things I was playing with at that time (late 2000 to early 2001, for those not keeping track) to the career in which I now call myself a professional.

**[fatDOG][1]** was so much more than that, though. I learned over the years that it was an arena for many of my friends &#8212; and even their friends &#8212; to express themselves in ways they could not afford to anywhere else. Some played with poetry to various degrees of success, others cranked out opinion pieces, and some put together serial stories that remain some of the best writing I&#8217;ve read.

    I don&#8217;t get much in the way of traffic on my blog&#8217;s comments, but always have good &#8216;ol Akismet kicking up lots of spam for me. Normally, it&#8217;s your usual, run-of-the-mill, easily-identifiable sex references, but occasionally it&#8217;s kind of mean. Case in point:

> I used to love reading your blog, but lately it’s been a little boring. I’ll still read it though =)

That&#8217;s harsh, spam robot! I&#8217;ve just started up blogging again and here you go knocking down my self-esteem. I suppose my blog *was* more original and interesting for the months upon months that I left it dormant. Now that I&#8217;m wasting your time spewing my thoughts into it, it&#8217;s a little hard to take, right? Sorry &#8217;bout that.

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    This was not a particularly great movie-going year for me. I just realized that I haven&#8217;t seen a single movie in the thick of the Oscar discussion for the overall picture, director, and actor/actress awards. I&#8217;ve leant strongly toward comedies, which makes this seem a bit of a more base list than I&#8217;d like, but it&#8217;s still worth a recap.

Here&#8217;s a look at all of the movies *first released* in 2010 that I happened to see &#8212; either in theater or otherwise &#8212; with a rundown of my thoughts. Movies are listed in order by release date.

**[<img class="alignleft" title="Leap Year Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/da/Leap_year_poster.jpg" alt="Leap Year Poster" width="125" />][1][Leap Year][1]**  
*with Amy Adams, Matthew Goode, and Adam Scott (a personal favorite of mine)*  
*Released to Theaters January 6. Seen on HBO in November.*  
In most ways, Leap Year, is an utterly predictable and fairly uninteresting romantic/road-trip comedy. Amy Adams is always wonderful to look at and plays the two traits of her role, well. Matthew Goode, who I know very little about, is perfectly great as the Irishman that wins her heart. It&#8217;s upsetting to see Adam Scott playing such a tool, here, but he&#8217;s good at it, and there&#8217;s the quick inclusion of Always Sunny&#8217;s Kaitlin Olsen. Anything that has any amount of Sweet Dee earns a few notches.

This was cutesy and well worth catching on cable. For its positives and generally vanilla lack of negatives, I give it **3 shamrocks of out 5**.

**[<img class="alignleft" title="The Crazies Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/Crazies_ver2.jpg" alt="The Crazies Poster" width="125" />][2][The Crazies][3]**  
*with Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell  
Released to Theaters February 26. Rented from Blockbuster (and subsequently returned late, which they still call me about) in August.*  
This being a George A. Romero production and a remake of a Romero classic, I had much much much (is that enough muches, yet?) higher hopes for this zombie-like-but-not-quite-zombie movie. There&#8217;s a contamination in the water source turning people in a podunk town all sorts of&#8230; get this&#8230; crazy. And who&#8217;s going to deal with them? The Sheriff, of course. If I&#8217;m being honest, this is a perfectly passable horror movie, with a handful of great scenes and sequences. Plus, there&#8217;s the whole &#8220;figure out if a member of our group is infected&#8221; thing, which is always a mind-bender&#8230; but this ain&#8217;t even a good zombie movie, let alone good movie.

Here&#8217;s to hoping they try harder on the next remake of Romero classic. I give The Crazies **2 out of 5 military containment officers**.

**[<img class="alignleft" title="Hot Tub Time Machine Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/64/Hot_tub_time_machine_poster.jpg" alt="Hot Tub Time Machine Poster" width="125" />][4][Hot Tub Time Machine][4]**  
*with John Cusack, Rob Corddry, Clark Duke, and Craig Robinson. Plus Chevy Chase!  
Released to Theaters March 26. Seen in theater on March 26. And again on HBO recently. *  
Having now seen this &#8220;film&#8221; for a second time, I can be more objective, but I&#8217;ll start by saying this movie gave moviegoers what it advertised: lots of 80&#8242;s references (both direct and sneaky), lots of stupid 80&#8242;s jokes, and lots of crude, juvenile humor. And you know what? It&#8217;s freaking fun to watch. It&#8217;s not a great time-travel movie. It&#8217;s not a great 80&#8242;s movie, which I suppose it only sort-of is in the first place. On the surface, it makes you feel like John Cusack grabbed some friends to go to the well for some cash, but there&#8217;s enough percolating in here (like everything involving Crispin Glover, the ski patrol kids mistaking the guys for Russian spies, or the many 80&#8242;s movie homages) that make you think it&#8217;s a real effort. And it&#8217;s pretty funny. If you bring your most critical eye, you&#8217;ll find every flaw, but if you sit back and enjoy the ride, you&#8217;ll be cracking up all the way through Rob Corddry&#8217;s Motlue Crue video in the end credits.

It&#8217;s worth a spin. I give it **4 russian energy drinks out of a possible 5**.

**[<img class="alignleft" title="Toy Story 3 Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/Toy_story3_poster3-1-.jpg" alt="Toy Story 3 Poster" width="125" />][5][Toy Story 3][5]**  
*with the voice talents of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and many more including Kristen Schaal!  
Released to the world June 18. [Seen in Bakersfield, CA while moving across the country on June 29][6].*  
The verdict on this one seems like it&#8217;s been settled since before or perhaps immediately after it&#8217;s release. Every critic and every fan seems to think this is Pixar&#8217;s finest movie and possibly one of the finest animated feature films ever. While I don&#8217;t disagree that it&#8217;s a great movie, this is not the best animated film ever made. It&#8217;s probably not the best Pixar movie and it may not even be the best Toy Story movie. BUT, all of that said, this is a great movie that &#8212; in true Pixar fashion &#8212; has layers that work for the kids, layers that work for the parents, and layers that work for people like me that are neither of the before stated categories. Seeing this in Bakersfield for something like $6 a ticket was a sweet plus, too! There&#8217;s not much to say that hasn&#8217;t been said, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with this Toy Story business, already. If you&#8217;ve seen 1 and 2, go see this one. If you haven&#8217;t seen the prequels, check those out and make it a point to see this quite great final chapter.

Give it a look as soon as you find yourself in the mood. **4 and 1/2 potato heads out of 5**.

**[<img class="alignleft" title="Knight and Day" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Knight_and_day_09.jpg" alt="Knight and Day Poster" width="125" height="185" />][7][Knight and Day][7]**  
*with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz  
Released to theaters June 23. Seen in theater in Flagstaff, AZ on July 1.*  
This movie apparently did not do well in US box office, but recouped expenses and much more internationally. It&#8217;s a shame it didn&#8217;t get seen by more people, because this movie was freaking great. This movie broke my long-lasting dislike of Tom Cruise, though my disdain was crumbling a bit after Tropic Thunder. The stunts, the sights, the love story, the action elements, and generally everything except the old man chewing popcorn loudly near me were great about this movie. I don&#8217;t even typically like Cameron Diaz, but this movie was really fun and exciting. It&#8217;s well-written, well-acted, and has a few great twists to keep you going. If a certain Scott Pilgrim hadn&#8217;t hit theaters later in the summer, this would have easily been the &#8220;funnest&#8221; movie I saw in 2010.

I highly recommend it, regardless of your feelings for or against Tom Cruise. I give it **5 out of 5 motorcycle chases**. Seriously.

I might as well get this out of the way. Despite my best intentions, I did miss the following summer biggies, which I&#8217;d fully hoped to see, during the busy July stretch. I hope to catch them, soon:

*   [Despicable Me][8], July 9. *It funny I didn&#8217;t see this, considering how much I quoted it throughout Liz&#8217; and my cross-country trip.*
*   [The Kids Are All Right][9], July 9. *I have a soft spot for Mark Ruffalo, but I&#8217;m not sure why.*
*   [Inception][10], July 16. *I swear I&#8217;ll see it soon. Nerds, stop chastising me for not having seen it, yet. And stop going on about the new Tron. I won&#8217;t ever see that.*
*   [Dinner for Schmucks][11], July 30. *It feels like this came out over a year ago with the way it came and went, but it has Steve Carrel, Paul Rudd, AND Jemaine Clement. That&#8217;s a trifecta for me.*

<span style="line-height: 24px;">Back to the next (and last) movie from 2010 that I actually did see:</span>

<span style="line-height: 24px;"><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World"><img class="alignleft" title="Scott Pilgrim vs the World Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World_teaser.jpg" alt="Scott Pilgrim vs the World Poster" width="125" /></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a></strong><br /> <em>with Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jason Schwartzman. Kieran Culkin steals many a scene, as well.<br /> Released in theaters August 13. Seen in theaters on August 13. Then again a week later.</em><br /> In know &#8212; Michael Cera&#8217;s probably worn out his welcome in your household, too. I mean, he&#8217;s always playing the same character and it&#8217;s rarely as likable as good &#8216;ol George Michael Bluth, am I right!? Not so, it turns out. This movie, done by the impeccable Edgar Wright of <em>Hot Fuzz</em> and <em>Shawn of the Dead</em> fame, is a re-imagining of a comic book series that actually draws direct inspiration from the panels on the comic pages. They did cram six full graphic novels into one movie, which leaves some plot lines unfinished and makes you feel it&#8217;s a big frayed around some edges, but the visuals, spot-on reproductions of the comic book characters, and killer soundtrack more than make up for it. Even if Michael Cera is making you queasy these days, you can look past some of his weird mannerisms and concentrate on the hilarious, witty, and fun interpretation of the absurd situations Scott Pilgrim gets into.</span>

<span style="line-height: 24px;">This movie didn&#8217;t get even make back its budget at the box office, which is a freakin&#8217; shame. Grab the DVD or catch this on Netflix ASAP. I give it a full <strong>5 out of 5 shipments from Amazon.ca</strong>. What&#8217;s the website for that, again?</span>

&#8211;

Awesome. The funniest thing about this year may be that I didn&#8217;t see another movie after Scott Pilgrim. I&#8217;ve been cruising through the list and can&#8217;t find another one I did see. There were ones I&#8217;d hoped to see, but I suppose I just didn&#8217;t set my watch to walk up and pay $10 for the &#8220;privilege&#8221; of trying them out.

In September, [The Town][12] and [Easy A][13] both happened, which I intended to see. [Let Me In][14], a fun-looking Americanization of *Let the Right One In*, dropped in October, along with [The Social Network][15], which is getting all sorts of praise. I missed them all. While I&#8217;m at it, I&#8217;ll point out that I also wanted to see [Nowhere Boy][16] and [Red][17], but couldn&#8217;t tell when they were coming out form their trailers. Into November, I missed [Harry Potter 7][18], which is pretty radical for someone who has seen all Harry Potter movies within a week of their opening. [Love and Other Drugs][19] looked good, but got lost in the holiday season along with [Black Swan][20] and that new Disney farce. I will soon enough see [The Fighter][21] and [True Grit][22], which came out in December, though probably not in that order. They both look spectacular.

So there you have it! A look back at a lackluster year of moviegoing from your&#8217;s truly.

    This thing is really fun and useful. I made a Pummelvision based on my Flickr photos, which are admittedly not up-to-date (large chunk missing in the middle), but this was still spectacular to watch. Probably moreso for me than you, but still.

Or bird, rather. This is Pepper, Liz&#8217; Mom&#8217;s bird. Pepper is very pretty (she even acknowledges this by saying &#8220;Pretty Birdy&#8221; often) and is kind of cute. And then you get near her and she becomes quite the pest.

You see, Pepper is pretty spoiled. She gets to do what she wants and most of the time she gets to do it when she wants. When her Mommy went out of town, however, on a recent vacation, most of the bird-sitting duties fell to&#8230; me&#8230; the stranger with the beard.

She didn&#8217;t take to me right away. Oh sure, I&#8217;d occasionally bring her over to the garbage can so she could poop away from her cage. And I&#8217;d occasionally make some sounds that she could respond to. But sometimes I&#8217;d forget to leave her music on. Or I&#8217;d not get downstairs early enough in the morning to let her out. Or I&#8217;d yell at her for squawking so loudly in my ear. It wasn&#8217;t her ideal arrangement. After all, where was her Mommy? Who is this guy?

But a funny thing happened halfway through her second day being stuck with me. She started to like me. She started to like me so much, in fact, that she wouldn&#8217;t leave me alone. She demanded that I let her sit on my shoulder. She chirped and cooed at me and rubbed her beak on me playfully. She cried when I left the room. She wouldn&#8217;t let me take her off of my shoulder. She was generally sick without me nearby.

And I finally understood. If you&#8217;re nice (enough) to the bird, she&#8217;ll come to accept you. And while I was nowhere near as cool as her Mommy, I was better than nobody. A lot better than nobody. So she clutched to me fiercely.

It all worked itself out. A vacation in Miami can last only so long and when it was over, Pepper&#8217;s Mommy returned. She has since calmed down considerably. Oh sure, I&#8217;m not really important to her, anymore, because her mom&#8217;s back, and I&#8217;m more comfortable \*not\* having a bird all over me half the time&#8230; but we&#8217;ll always have those four or so days.

We&#8217;ll always have that.

    It&#8217;s time, my fair readers, to continue our trip down memory lane. Specifically, memories that I don&#8217;t have of films I never saw from 2009. Without any further ado, I present the continuation (and likely the conclusion) of **Movies I Missed from 2009**, picking up where we left off in August:

In related matters, you may want to [read the first part of this list][1] before continuing. *Now* let&#8217;s continue:

### [It Might Get Loud][2] &#8211; August

I&#8217;m not normally much of a documentary fan (though a few have sparked and held my interest over the years), but this seemed like a good, old-fashioned, awesome time. Comparing and contrasting the careers of Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge with lots of concert and backstage performance material must&#8217;ve been a blast to film and put together for filmmaker Davis Guggenheim, and I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;s a joy to watch and listen to at home. Plans? **Watch on DVD soon**.

  </h3>
  
  <p>
    This is the 2009 movie that I receive the most flak for not yet having seen. Hands down. I always like a good Tarantino film and was excited for this one&#8217;s release, but never put together a visit to the theater for it. This film has already received its fair share of accolades for its acting, period production, and directing, and will surely be something I snatch up the opportunity to see soon. Plus, my good friend dressed up as Brad Pitt&#8217;s character for Halloween and was appalled I didn&#8217;t pick up on it quickly. Plans? <strong>DVD as soon as I find the time</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fan">Big Fan</a> &#8211; August
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Patton Oswalt, normally known for his childish and comedic antics, takes a creepy/sad/dramatic turn here as super fan Paul Aufiero, the self-proclaimed &#8220;biggest NY Giants fan in the world.&#8221; He trades barbs with &#8220;Philadelphia Phil&#8221; over a nightly radio broadcast at night, earning his keep as a parking garage attendant by day. When he and his best friend spot their favorite player while out for the night in Statten Island, they follow him and his entourage to Manhattan, where they&#8217;re accused of being stalkers. Oswalt&#8217;s character is beaten within an inch of his life and now must decide on taking legal/criminal action against the best player on his favorite team while dealing with a wide array of family pressures. This movie flew in under the radar, but I&#8217;ve been bent on seeing it since I first checked out the trailer on Apple&#8217;s site. Plans? <strong>I&#8217;m about halfway through it on Netflix Instant right now.</strong>
  </p>

### [Extract][3] &#8211; September

It&#8217;s about that time. Time for Mike Judge to make another film that splits critics and box offices alike. How could this one miss with Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, JK Simmons, and even Ben Affleck taking turns giving their comedic best? To be perfectly frank, I&#8217;m not even sure what factors move the plot of this movie, but I know that I&#8217;m just more than likely to love anything Judge puts out. Unfortunately for him, I&#8217;m like most everyone else, and won&#8217;t enjoy this one until **DVD**.

### [The Informant!][4] &#8211; September

How was this movie not a huge success!? Matt Damon (who, at this point, is almost always incredible) playing a high-ranking executive turned hilariously bumbling whistle blower already sounds like a farce worth betting on. Plus! Joel McHale plays a pretty decent-sized part. I&#8217;m sold. Still worth tracking down? Yes. And **worth a DVD rental**.

### [The Invention of Lying][5] &#8211; October

Ricky Gervais movie. Done. But! A movie set in an alternate reality where everyone tells the truth, except for this one dude (Gervais) who schemes a small lie in a quandary over his rent? Seems plausibly weird and fun. **Worth a look once it hits cable**.

### [Whip It][6] &#8211; October

So this is a chick flick directed by Drew Barrymore. That sounds like a rough draw, but Ellen Page has stolen movies to success, before, and this just had the feel from its trailers of another good show. A country girl finding her calling in joining a roller derby team that has Kristen Wiig as a member plus as a bonus she has a friend in Maebe Fünke (Alia Shawkat)! Awesome. **May wait for TV or jump on a DVD**.

### [Couples Retreat][7] &#8211; October

I know. The reviews were bad. The trailer was kind of bad. Vince Vaughn was playing the same character he always does. Jon Favreau hasn&#8217;t done much redeeming work since directing *Elf*. The deck is stacked hard against this one, but I can&#8217;t let the dream that every Jason Bateman movie is gold die. I&#8217;ll have to see for myself, just **maybe not anytime soon**.

### [An Education][8] &#8211; October

1960&#8242;s coming of age movies are probably the best type of coming of age movies. That this one is British probably helps it in a few key regards. The sexual and relationship patterns in this movie would be a blast for a psychologist to examine, which I think makes this interesting. **I&#8217;ll catch it on TV**.

### [Where the Wild Things Are][9] &#8211; October

It is one of the bigger let downs of my 2009 that I didn&#8217;t make time to see this movie. Everything I&#8217;ve heard is everything you&#8217;ve heard: it&#8217;s a beautiful, poignant, and original take on a cherished children&#8217;s story. They turned 20-or-so pages of illustrated artwork and a few run-on sentences into a full length feature, but didn&#8217;t miss a step. The costumes, scenery, animation, and everything are brilliant. Why didn&#8217;t I skip work to see this one, again!? **Must watch. Quick**.

### [Precious][10] &#8211; November

While October was a pretty good month for movies I missed, gear up for November. *Precious* starts off the November set with a bang. I think the primary reason I missed this movie is that I was just never set or ready to go see it. It will take a lot out of someone to watch another person be beaten, berated, belittled, and attacked on screen. This is certainly a serious movie with serious material, and word on the street is that it&#8217;s all well done. Mo&#8217;nique is earning favoritism for an Oscar and the star Gabourey Sidibe is fantastic (so say the critics). Sidibe is pretty awesome, too, as she was one of the best guests Conan O&#8217;Brien had this past fall when she was on tour for the movie. **Should see ASAP**.

### [Pirate Radio][11] &#8211; November

I didn&#8217;t know this previously, but *Pirate Radio* is actually *The Boat That Rocked*, a British import that was re-cut and re-titled for US release after its critical and box office failure overseas. That cuts this movie down a bit for me, but I&#8217;ve got to say they did a bang up job with the trailers. I&#8217;m sad to read that the movie failed commercially and that it wasn&#8217;t well-received, but still think it looks like a good way to spend a couple hours of my time. **I&#8217;ll probably catch it on Netflix**.

### [Fantastic Mr. Fox][12] &#8211; November

As with *Coraline* before it in 2009, *Mr. Fox* aims high with its stop-motion animation and starts with absolutely excellent source material from Roald Dahl&#8217;s original childrens&#8217; book. I&#8217;m a sucker for anything Dahl, but am over a barrel to see this movie with the talents of Wes Anderson behind and Clooney, Streep, Murray, and Schwartzman in front of the camera. Well, their voices, at least. Quick fact: Henry Sellick was co-directing with Anderson on this one until the original studio folded and he left to direct *Coraline*. That there was early project turmoil is not enough to deter me from **getting this on the Netflix queue as soon as its out**.

### [The Messenger][13] &#8211; November

This movie follows *The Hurt Locker* on this list in the military epic class, but attacks the effects on personnel back here at home. Ben Foster plays a soldier who is assigned to work with the Army&#8217;s Casualty Notification service upon returning from tours in Iraq. He pairs with a veteran mentor to the task in Woody Harrelson. While struggling with the mission at hand, a love story develops between Foster&#8217;s character a wife he has notified of her husband&#8217;s death. This movie flew under-the-radar a bit, but has earned great acclaim. That Harrelson appeared in this in the same month as *Zombieland* is wickedly interesting. **Must see when ready**.

### [The Road][14] &#8211; November

Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s novel features life of a man and his son living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic wasteland, scavenging along a great trip south. Along the way, they must avoid cannibals and other obstacles in this dreary life. Viggo Mortensen is a solid actor worth seeing in most anything, and this movie seemed like just the downer of a vehicle to let the dramatic chops fly. I want to see it, but **after reading the book**.

### [Brothers][15] &#8211; December

I saw a trailer for this one night and was immediately hooked. To have Tobey Maguire, of all actors, in the incredibly creepy tormented brother role is a nice twist. Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are excellent actors, as well, rounding out the core of a talented cast. In this movie, a family that has moved on after their father (Maguire) goes missing and is pronounced dead in Iraq, hears news that their father is alive and returning home. His wife (Portman) and brother (Gylenhaal) have bonded in the time since he has left and his return dismantles the family that had learned to cope with his loss. Seems like it could have been a tear-jerker, but they crafted it into a psychological thriller&#8230; or I&#8217;m misreading its advertisements. Either way, I&#8217;m in for a **quick Netflix catchup**.

### [Crazy Heart][16] &#8211; December

I&#8217;m going to be totally serious with you on this one. It&#8217;s getting rave reviews and there is Oscar talk abounding for the music and movie. And the main character is The Dude, perhaps better known to most as Jeff Bridges. Having recently re-watched *The Big Lebowski*, I&#8217;m all in for *Crazy Heart*, however incomparable those two films are. **DVD only if I can&#8217;t get to a theater soon enough**

### [Avatar][17] &#8211; December

I have \*very\* mixed feelings about this one. I really had little interest in seeing it. I thought it was going to be stupid and had a heavily recycled plot and maybe too many special effects and not enough substance. Those things may all be true, but the movie has grossed over $2bil and people are still going crazy over it. I&#8217;ve heard (and believe) it must be seen in the theater in 3D, and that&#8217;s probably what I&#8217;ll buckle down and do. I mean, it&#8217;s not going anywhere anytime soon. Verdict? **Theater probably**, if not &#8212; then what?

And that about does it. That&#8217;s my list of Movies I Missed from 2009 &#8212; the movies I wanted to see, but didn&#8217;t get around to for one reason or another. Stay tuned this week for more movie-related list geekery and let me know if you agree, disagree, or have advice for anything based on my list by commenting.

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    I consider myself a fan of movies. Film, even. I like to watch movies. I like to talk about movies. I have an innate ability to &#8220;date&#8221; a movie and tell you its year of release (normally exact, sometimes within a year) just because I seem to keep my ear to the ground when it comes to that sort of thing.

So in the vein of movies, I present to you, dear reader, my first movie list from 2009. Yes, I realize we are now squarely in February of 2010, but these things take time. We&#8217;re coming into awards season full-on with Oscar nominations to be announced tomorrow. My first list, no doubt, includes some likely Oscar noms in it:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>The Moves I Missed from 2009</strong>
</p>

These are movies I fully intended to see. I really wanted to get to them, either because they looked good in commercial, I&#8217;d read about them online, or they featured actors I love. For some reason or another (laziness, cost-cutting, forgetfulness, inability to drag anyone else along with me, etc.), these are the movies that I never made it to from 2009, in order of release.

### [Coraline][1] &#8211; February

Dakota Fanning voices a young girl that navigates her way through a surreal and creepy netherworld of sorts&#8230; in full 3D stop-motion animation!? There aren&#8217;t enough movies that aim this high anymore, and the allusions to The Nightmare Before Christmas are many. This was playing in 3D a few places in the city, and I never made it. Verdict? I&#8217;ll be **catching up on DVD soon**.

### [Fanboys][2] &#8211; February

When the previews sold it accurately as a band of post high school nerds reunited over a plan to break in Skywalker Ranch heading up to the release of 1998&#8242;s The Phantom Menace, I became very excited. A period piece about Star Wars fans with mad cap antics, guest cameos, and all sorts of other fun can&#8217;t go wrong. Then I couldn&#8217;t find it listed anywhere and before too long forgot it had come out in theaters. The film didn&#8217;t do well (and wasn&#8217;t reviewed very well to boot), but there&#8217;s still a part of me that plans to seek this one out. Verdict? **Probably DVD**, maybe catch-up on TV.

### [Sunshine Cleaning][3] &#8211; March

I think Amy Adams and Emily Blunt can light up the screen, so that&#8217;s excuse enough to see a movie that features both of them. That the producers are those from another well-received movie with &#8220;Sunshine&#8221; in its title (2006&#8242;s Little Miss Sunshine) is another push in the right direction. In the film, the two start a business cleaning crime scenes and learn a lot about their roll in helping others cope with loss. Throughout, they are confronted with their own unresolved feelings regarding their mother&#8217;s suicide. It&#8217;s heavy subject matter with a sunny title, and I&#8217;m still interested. Verdict = **Definitely DVD**.

### [The Haunting in Connecticut][4] &#8211; March

This horror movie is based on true events and I&#8217;ve seen enough specials about the house and family in question to know that it&#8217;s some real, serious stuff. A family moves into a former mortuary. That&#8217;s the setting. Add in a gateway to hell, the possession of a son who moves into the basement, and a boatload of creepy imagery and you&#8217;ve put together a pretty adequate horror movie. Now that I think back to this one, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;d be worth seeking out, but I&#8217;d stop on the channel for a while should it pop up on TNT or FX in a year. Verdict? **Won&#8217;t try to *not* see it**.

### [Adventureland][5] &#8211; April

This has been described to me as &#8220;Superbad without all of the jokes,&#8221; but I&#8217;ve also heard a lot of good things about it from trusted movie-opinionated friends. The key thing is that I&#8217;m a sucker for most movies Ryan Reynolds is a part of (save for Smokin&#8217; Aces&#8230; ugh) and Jesse Eisenberg seems, to me, like Michael Cera if Michael Cera didn&#8217;t get all annoying. So, cool. Verdict? **I&#8217;ll probably Netflix Instant it**.

### [The Soloist][6] &#8211; April

Has anyone before ever resurrected a career the way Robert Downey, Jr. has resurrected his career over the past couple of years? He&#8217;s a personality that really owns a movie when given the chance, and this always looked like a serious movie that was going to happen in. Jamie Fox, we&#8217;ve seen, is surprisingly better in serious roles, and seemed like excellent casting in this drama about a homeless cello prodigy with schizophrenia looking for an opportunity to succeed. That sentence sounded right out of the trailer, just put &#8220;In a world&#8221; in front of it. I tend to catch up on comedy faster than drama, but perhaps this one will get seen soon. Verdict? **Good to go for Netflix Instant** sometime down the line.

### [Drag Me to Hell][7] &#8211; May

As we&#8217;ve already covered, I&#8217;m a sucker for some good horror (see *Haunting in Connecticut, The*). This movie has the doubly good fortune of being a Sam Raimi flick. Yes, he of The Evil Dead fame. The plot seems about as shabby as you&#8217;d expect &#8212; a banker denies an old lady an extension on her mortgage and is cursed for eternity in response &#8212; but plot&#8217;s not the point. This movie looks like it features a lot of good quick scares, makeup, and visuals that help prop up the lesser plot. And let&#8217;s be honest, that&#8217;s a good enough plot to lean on for a horror movie these days, anyway. Verdict? I&#8217;m sure this **won&#8217;t take long to get to cable**.

### [The Taking of Pelham 123][8] &#8211; June

John Travolta and Denzel Washington, together at last! Yes, this is a remake. And yes, I&#8217;ve heard the original is quite good. But still, seeing John Travolta play the creepy bad guy instead of the heartwarming good guy gives me shivers of 1997 as it gets me thinking of the switcheroo good-guy/bad-guy Travolta from Face Off. Verdict? I&#8217;ll take it all the way to **Netflix, eventually**.

### [Year One][9] &#8211; June

It&#8217;s important to note this list is just as much as list of movies I \*wanted\* to see as it is a list of movies I now \*want\* to see. We&#8217;ve all heard the reviews that slammed this movie as sophomoric and stupid. I am not deaf to these claims, but point out that Michael Cera and Jack Black as cavemen with a guest appearances by McLovin and David Cross can&#8217;t be all that bad. Can it? Maybe it can, now that I think about it. Verdict? I&#8217;ll **catch it on cable**.

### [The Hurt Locker][10] &#8211; June

Having recently spoken to director Kathryn Bigelow in person (albeit not about this movie, but instead about my crack, on-the-spot, improvised role in a recent showing of [Point Break Live][11]), I&#8217;d much like to see this movie. But even before that chance encounter, this movie was something I wanted to give a good look. Military dramas are not often my thing, but this movie is a highly-acclaimed film detailing the painful exposure to war-time situations in Iraq, as well as issues of re-deployment and more. Verdict? **Definite DVD soon**.

### [Public Enemies][12] &#8211; July

Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. Gunfire. Bank robberies. Explosions. Prison escapes. Excitement. Verdict? **Streamed over the Netflix tubes**.

### [Brüno][13] &#8211; July

I don&#8217;t think anyone needs a reason or excuse to see Sacha Baron Cohen performing as any one of his characters. Friends had mixed reviews, but I&#8217;m going to have to see for myself sometime, yeah? Verdict? Can&#8217;t wait for the censored version, so I&#8217;ll have to **Netflix it, but I&#8217;m not in a rush**.

### [Orphan][14] &#8211; July

File this as another &#8220;I&#8217;m a sucker for horror films&#8221; entry. The concept, though it is very *The Omen*-esque, is just a creepy one. This was heavily advertised, and that&#8217;s either a good thing or a bad thing. Verdict? **I&#8217;ll see it when I see it**, but I will definitely see it.

### [District 9][15] &#8211; August

This is the movie that every geek was going crazy over this summer. Early in the year, it was *Watchmen* (stay tuned for that movie&#8217;s appearance in another list of mine), then it was this one. &#8220;Peter Jackson has done it again&#8221; was a frequent comment. The entire concept and its storytelling links to South African Apartheid make this a culturally relevant story worth tracking down, whereas the content and style make it a summer movie worth checking out. The verdict? I&#8217;ll catch it at **home on DVD soon**.

### [The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard][16] &#8211; August

I hate to say it, but Jeremy Piven is becoming less cool to me. He seems like he&#8217;s always playing Ari from &#8220;Entourage&#8221; these days, but then again maybe he always has been. That this movie seems like a cheap remake of one of my all-time favorite comedies, [*Used Cars*][17], is another subtraction for this one. However, if this movie gets anywhere near the classic *Used Cars* in quality or quantity of laughs, it has a lot going for it. I&#8217;m sure to point out that it&#8217;s a different movie, but I&#8217;m still going to see how it stacks up. The verdict? **It&#8217;s in the Netflix Queue**.

&#8230;

The shocking and exciting conclusion to this list is now up! Check out [Movies I Missed from 2009, Part Two][18].

I&#8217;ll be sure to follow later this week with more 2009 lists, so stay tuned.

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    Supporting Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most frustrating things about my job. It seems like a petty thing to worry one&#8217;s self over, but it&#8217;s come to this.

I work for a marketing agency that builds social marketing applications and ad campaigns in the world&#8217;s largest social networks. Paramount among these social networks is Facebook. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of it. One thing you may not know about Facebook is that they&#8217;ve not been officially tailoring to Internet Explorer 6 for some time, now. As a user of an outdated browser (even Firefox 2, Safari 2, and other oldies), you see this message on your home screen post-login:

<div id="attachment_89" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px">
  <img class="size-medium wp-image-89" title="ie6_fb_msg" src="http://colinmccloskey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ie6_fb_msg-300x68.png" alt="What you see when you login to Facebook with an outdated browser" width="300" height="68" /><p class="wp-caption-text">
    What you see when you login to Facebook with an outdated browser
  </p>
</div>

While this does not itself represent a failure to support the browser completely, it is an indication that your browser may render things a bit differently, because it&#8217;s old. They go so far as to provide helpful links to make your path to upgrade simple. As I understand it, this screen is Facebook&#8217;s way of saying, &#8220;Hey. Your browser is old. We can&#8217;t make everything look perfect for you until you upgrade.&#8221;

The message isn&#8217;t rude. It&#8217;s not forceful. They don&#8217;t prevent you from using the site,  and most of the things you&#8217;ll do with Facebook-proper look pretty fine in your old browser. Not *everything*, but *most* things.

I&#8217;ve felt for a long time that this is a good approach to web development &#8212; do your best to support the bleeding edge, and scale back your efforts on the lower end of the spectrum. Once it becomes a frustration and hassle to support things in the oldest of platforms, cut out the old platforms. Microsoft even acknowledges this, as they haven&#8217;t allowed IE6 or any of its lesser forefathers to even be installed on Windows Vista or the forthcoming Windows 7 ([see chart of Microsoft&#8217;s commendably aggressive history of putting old browsers out to pasture][1]). By focusing your efforts on the future, you are enhancing your own products going forward, without concerning yourself with the past. Odds are, the customers you are likely to attract with new and fun things are the ones running the more recent technologies themselves.

Internet Explorer 6 was a great browser. It was the industry benchmark for awesomeness&#8230; when it was released&#8230; in August, 2001. Eight years ago! I commend it for being a stable platform that opened doorways to a lot of advanced web development that has taken place in the past eight years. Unfortunately, it has been showing it&#8217;s age for years, now (I could list those reasons, here, but feel [an excellent job is done in this post of hate declaration][2]). It&#8217;s lack of support for some basic principles of design used in today&#8217;s development cycle make it the most hated thing for developers and designers like myself.

Why not just cut it off? Stop supporting it? Good question! The answer most development houses and agencies fall back on varies a bit, but always contains an amalgamation of the following points:

*   Clients use IE6 as their primary browser at work.
*   Many of these clients use corporate computers they have no ability to upgrade.
*   IT staffs at many corporations are remiss to upgrade IE6 because some variety of intranet or HR software that was written over five years ago doesn&#8217;t look good in any other browser
*   IE6 still maintains a considerable market share of overall Internet browsing ([something near 15% at my last check][3])
*   The client told us we have to support it

These reasons are understandable. They make sense. But they indicate a problem wherein clients (often large, lazy corporations behind on their technology) are thinking about *themselves* and not their *customers*. It is absolutely true that the browser distribution in corporate settings is ridiculously still IE6-leaning, but that is no indicator of a general consumer population, which is rejecting the browser for newer alternatives, be it the latest Internet Explorer (version 8 is joy to use over its ugly older step-siblings), FireFox (infinitely extensible, pretty fast, and standards compliant), Safari on macs (delightful to use and test on), or even Google&#8217;s Chrome (pretty slick). Consumers get it. They&#8217;ve upgraded and are using newer stuff.

So what it comes down to is corporate clients should take faith in the fact that the public is using newer technology then those within their walls and they should embrace that reality.

And agencies (like my own) should grow a pair and convince clients that the future is now. The past is the past. Look forward. You&#8217;ll be able to build a better, more feature-ful product. Plus you&#8217;ll get it in less time since there won&#8217;t be as wide an array of awful compliance testing for developers to engage in.

Oh, and you&#8217;ll make my life easier, but that&#8217;s just an added benefit. For me, at least.

Please?

    I love dogs. They are both special and awesome. Now, I hate most email forwards, but my aunt sent me a particularly nice one that made me happy, so I figured I&#8217;d post it here:

**A Dog's Purpose**

Being a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog&#8217;s owners, Ron, his wife Lisa, and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.

I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn&#8217;t do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.

    When new people join an organization, company, or group of people, it is the job of the existing folks to bring that new person up-to-speed. During this process, the old-timer has a choice to make regarding their attitude in this indoctrination:

*   &#8220;I love it here and everything is awesome&#8221;
*   &#8220;Things here are cool, but here&#8217;s some sour points&#8221;
*   &#8220;This place sucks&#8221;

When I&#8217;m the old-timer in a scenario like this, I tend to always fall into the second group of people. Why!?

It doesn&#8217;t seem to even matter how I actually feel. If I&#8217;m more honestly in the first or third category, I still pull myself into this category that has mastered the soft touch. I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m putting myself in the new person&#8217;s shoes, because I&#8217;m reevaluating my own personal thinking, or something else.

In a job interview, if someone asks a question such as &#8220;what is the typical project life-cycle like around here?&#8221; &#8212; a very excellent question for an interviewing developer &#8212; I tend to answer at length rather than quickly. &#8220;Typically, the turnover is pretty quick. But some projects can run long because of client delays. It&#8217;s like this one project I&#8217;m on&#8230;. or this other one I&#8217;m working through&#8230;. or this one we had a couple months back&#8230;. yadda yadda&#8230;.&#8221; At a time when I should be upselling and singing the praises of our lifecycle I tend to fall back into this reality-stricken middleground.

This is even true of when I&#8217;m the new guy, too. I always straddle this in-between spot of not getting my expectations up or holding back in my degree of excitement. This has been very noticeable in the past few months as I&#8217;ve met new people and explore new things in San Francisco.

I want to be cordial and friendly and interested, and I temper my highs and lows in order to do this. Maybe this makes me more accurate on the overall. Or maybe this just makes me boring.

    If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve had the pleasure recently of ticketing your friends, skirting the law, and earning new cars and badges in [Parking Wars][1] for a bit of time, now. *For the record: I&#8217;m nearing $750,000 in the app and am fending off charges from friends of lesser value while trying to climb ever-closer to friends that have more bank.* It&#8217;s addictive, this game!

That&#8217;s why it was fun to see this when I tried to park my cars a bit, just now:

<a href="http://mccolin.com/2008/04/02/its-a-war-out-there/parking-wars-is-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-19" title="Parking Wars is Down"></a>

</p>

It was maddening, to me, to not be able to move and shift fake cars around on fake streets run virtually by my real friends.

*(All usage figures used below from [Adonomics][2] reports, April 2, 2008) *

When a social networking application can become this addictive and enticing, it&#8217;s a seriously great score. It&#8217;s impressive. There have been studies that say an application &#8212; game or otherwise useful utility &#8212; has somewhere between 30 seconds and one minute to impress (or annoy!) the average Facebook user before they decide to uninstall the application. As most of these applications are attempting to leverage some sort of advertising angle, it&#8217;s a very make-or-break medium.

While I can&#8217;t confirm with numbers that A&E is seeing an uptick in website traffic or viewership for the television program the game is modeled after, I can confirm with numbers that the application itself is proving to be one of the most engaging and actively-used applications in the Facebook realm:

<p class="dataRight">
  Over 90 thousand people use Parking Wars every day. That&#8217;s nearly one-third of all of the 300 thousand plus people that currently have it installed. Somehow, in this realm of shortened attention spans, the folks behind Parking Wars have found a way to get one in every three of their users to return every day!
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  That&#8217;s unheard of. Well, not entirely. Let me give you an idea of how Parking Wars compares to some of the other top applications on Facebook: it ranks #64 in daily engagement (that one-third of people come back every day makes for a very high ranking) and is #498 in total installed user base.
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  While being barely in the top 500 might seem unimpressive, you should realize that being #498 out of #21,848 is a big feat. It&#8217;s right above &#8220;Are You A Bitch,&#8221; right behind &#8220;Which Hollywood Superstar Are You?&#8221; and interestingly close to an application my company has developed &#8211; <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/smartypants/" title="Smarty Pants for Facebook">Smarty Pants</a> (which sits at #518 with 285,000 total users, 8,550 of which come back every day).
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  As companies, advertising agencies, and marketing folk attempt to get a handle on how powerful social networking can be, they should observe applications like Parking Wars. There&#8217;s interesting pulls that keep users checking daily, whether it be defending themselves from ticket-happy friends, attempting to get the most money for their actions (it&#8217;s all virtual dollars, sadly), or just going in a punishing their friends for parking a black car in a yellow cars only zone.
</p>

<p class="dataRight">
   If Parking Wars doesn&#8217;t quite end up driving viewership to their television programming, it at least will go a great distance toward improving their brand image and introducing the A&E brand to the younger demographic available of Facebook. Perhaps in the near future they can find even better ways to pull people like me out of their daily routine to check a social networking application every so often. Good work if they manage it!

    It&#8217;s been almost two weeks since I made the move from New Jersey to San Francisco. About thirteen days. Some moments it feels like it&#8217;s been longer and other times it feels like it&#8217;s been no time at all, though admittedly more of the former than the latter.

Now, enough time hasn&#8217;t elapsed where I&#8217;d be able to make sweeping statements of &#8220;west coast attitude vs. east coast attitude&#8221; or anything remotely similar. That&#8217;s not something one can qualify in this short period of time. So much goes into making quality statements like that. Is it a city versus suburbs difference? Is it a California versus New Jersey difference? Is it a hipster versus sub-metro difference? Is it something else? Is it just the ridiculous differences in weather, perhaps!?

What I have learned from my time in this city is that there are many friendly people willing to meet a new face, chat with them, show them around, and have a good time with them. I&#8217;ve met a decently large amount of people in my short time out here, largely in part to the welcoming ways ways of my new housemates and co-workers. Whether or not the welcoming attitude is a personality trait inherent to these fine people or inherent to the region from which they come is something I can&#8217;t determine. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s the people.

If you have an open mind and are willing to break &#8212; at least a bit &#8212; from any shell you might be in, moving to a city can be an invigorating experience. I still find myself being a bit hesitant to &#8220;jump in&#8221; in certain respects, but *far* less so than I thought I&#8217;d be. I&#8217;ve tried new things, changed my eating habits, learned and successfully navigated multiple types of public transportation, gone to several parties and outings, and done some exploring.

Sure, I&#8217;m still wrapped up in a personal cocoon a bit, but it&#8217;s nothing major.  It&#8217;s important to me to maintain my sense of self while learning, experiencing, and taking new aspects for that self. As long as I&#8217;m doing things because I truly want to attempt them or learn about them and not because I feel a social pretext or need to, I will be happy with myself. And, thankfully, there are tons of ways to do that in this new locale.

Work is so far very good. I enjoy the company of my colleagues and feel we are doing well meeting each other. The job is fun and exciting and entails work with technologies I am excited about daily. It is thrilling to work for a variety of clients and brands in the span of a week and to have my work be touched by end users thousands of times over. That I get to balance significant amounts of technical *and* creative skills in my work is something I&#8217;m very glad about.

Home is becoming more so in rapid chunks of time. It&#8217;s difficult to be engaging and full of energy each day after work, but the relationships I&#8217;m building with housemates and friends are already becoming rewarding and fun. I am comfortable and much sooner than I&#8217;d anticipated. The tiny barriers that exist are all from my own personal end and are sure to be down before long. That, and, getting furniture in my room would go a great distance to making me physically &#8220;set.&#8221;

Missing home is pretty much as I&#8217;d anticipated: it sucks. So many people back home have been very curious about the move and also understanding of any less-than-reasonable time it&#8217;s taken me to get back to them while I get settled. Don&#8217;t let anyone convince you that a three-hour time difference is no big deal &#8212; it is *significant*. Phone calls, emails, online chats, and any form of communication take on a different timing and sometimes have to juggle two independent contexts that can be so very frustrating. It&#8217;s really limiting and confining in a lot of respects, but I am finding adequate (not great, but adequate) ways around the limitations.

So, in summation: so far, so good. San Francisco has proven itself to be a beautiful, friendly, and fun place to live. Work is fun and challenging at the same time. People are thus far wonderful and welcoming.

I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m still on the way, but in reality I&#8217;m already here.

    *Warning: Ideas expressed a million times over by a million other people appear on in this post!*

This is a very weird age to be. By that I mean that being post-college, pre-family (or pre-life, really) is a weird place to be. We&#8217;ve spent all of this time being told we should go to school for education and experience to prepare us for life and while it has helped prepare us in so many ways, there&#8217;s no real way to prepare for the void many people find themselves in post-college, pre-life. I said pre-family before, because I suppose that&#8217;s what I think I&#8217;d like to get to, but it&#8217;s not everyone&#8217;s bag, so whatev.

It&#8217;s that weirdness, though, that I&#8217;ve been feeling and writing a lot about, lately. There&#8217;s this urge I have to go do something totally great and unexpected and wild, but there&#8217;s this tether inside me that wants to avoid rocking the boat or straying from this course I&#8217;ve been set on my entire life. The real glitch is that I&#8217;m realizing more and more these days that course is all unchartered for the time and place in my life where I currently am. So it goes.

That&#8217;s where life takes over in most incredible stories and that&#8217;s where I have to allow it to take over by trying new things and exploring my desires without the tether, I think. We&#8217;ll see.

That&#8217;s the mentality that&#8217;s been going into things like &#8220;[I Don&#8217;t Have Friends][1].&#8221; Some mentality where I&#8217;m realizing it&#8217;s okay to not be happy all of the time, so long as you realize it and personally enact some change to improve that state.

Having *something *exciting going in one&#8217;s life can go a long way towards this cause. What I need to do is find some thing, some place, or some person in my life that will make days exciting &#8212; or at least keep me going. It&#8217;s not all on that thing, place, or person, not at all. It&#8217;s more on me to find and nurture whatever it is I find that keeps me excited so I can keep going.

And that, my friends, is life. Fickle broad.

    Converting potential energy into kinetic energy happens all of the time. You roll a ball down a hill. You knock something off of a table. You tap your foot. It&#8217;s easy.

So why, then, is it so difficult to turn inspiration into action? If you think about it, inspiration is the potential for some action. An idea strikes you and then you set out about turning that idea into something concrete.

Lately, I seem to be able to get things out of my head and onto paper, but never beyond that. I can&#8217;t make a song into music. I can&#8217;t make a design into a website. I can&#8217;t seem to dedicate myself to the real work. I&#8217;m not lazy. I&#8217;m tired. And, yes, there&#8217;s a difference. Being tired comes from exhaustion, stress, the fact that I have to spend eight hours of my day working on other ideas that aren&#8217;t always mine so I can provide for myself and make a living. It all leaves me exhausted and unable or sometimes unwilling to really work on my own ideas.

Where do the great innovators find the time? Do they neglect their work, families, and friends? Do they live with nothing while they devote themselves to their next-big-something?

If that&#8217;s what it takes, why can&#8217;t I find the courage within myself to set out and attempt it? Forgo the typicalities of the &#8220;real&#8221; world while I work on my masterpiece?

I don&#8217;t know.

But I do.

I&#8217;m afraid to.

Or I&#8217;m too busy thinking about how it must not be necessary to make such great sacrifices just to begin a search for success. Sure, to eventually make something of myself, I&#8217;ll have to sacrifice some big things along the way, but right from the get go? Funny. Because all of the time I&#8217;m wasting worrying and thinking about it is being spent by other, more fastidious and more brilliant people to get where they want to be headed.

Shit.
