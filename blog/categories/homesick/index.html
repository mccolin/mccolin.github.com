    Perfect for a warm summer day. Not a salad you&#8217;ve added shrimp to, but a chilled pasta and shrimp sensation! Plus, there&#8217;s mayonnaise, so it&#8217;s extra indulgent&#8230; yes, that&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m going for&#8230; indulgent.

You will need:

*   2 cans of Tiny shrimp (Bumble Bee brand is great, substitute Small if your grocer does not have Tiny)
*   1 lb. box of Medium (or Small) Shell Pasta
*   1 onion (sweet or not, pick your poison)
*   Some celery (no exact amount)
*   Some mayo (again, not exact)
*   Salt, pepper, spices

Take the next 20-30 minutes to prepare, thusly:

1.  Cook pasta. This will take about 20 minutes between bringing the water to a boil and the 12-14 minute cooking time. Which is great, because while it&#8217;s cooking, you&#8230;
2.  Dice the onion and celery. Finely diced is best, but this is an inexact science type of dish, so don&#8217;t sweat it.
3.  When ready, drain the pasta, let it cool a bit (don&#8217;t rinse it, just let it cool in your strainer)
4.  Empty the pasta in a big mixing/salad bowl and add salt and pepper to taste. I also sometimes add oregano or light garlic spices, so play with it a bit. Don&#8217;t over-do it, because next you&#8217;ll&#8230;
5.  Add the diced onions and celery.
6.  Open the cans of shrimp, drain the water from them, and add the shrimp to the bowl and mix everything together with a spatula or wooden spoon.
7.  Add mayo. Add it in rounds, you&#8217;d like your component parts to all have some mayo on them, but by no means be covered in the stuff.
8.  Cover the bowl. Chill for a few hours in the fridge.
9.  Remove from the fridge when cold, give it another few stirs and dish it out.

You can try this with any type of pasta, but the shells are the best, because they occasionally create these shrimp-onion-celery-pasta bombs in one single bite when they catch everything together. It&#8217;s grand.

This makes me think of my Mom. It makes me think of summer. It makes me happy. It&#8217;s a perfect compliment to burgers, hot dogs, and anything else you&#8217;re whipping up on the grill.

Enjoy.

    Today, I captured all of the contents of articles that were submitted to my favorite website from ten years ago and tucked them behind a locked door. I am, of course, speaking of **[fatDOG][1]**, the personal website of mine that exploded into an online journal featuring more than 30 authors when I took my first public foray into data-backed website development.

One could almost draw a straight line from the technical things I was playing with at that time (late 2000 to early 2001, for those not keeping track) to the career in which I now call myself a professional.

**[fatDOG][1]** was so much more than that, though. I learned over the years that it was an arena for many of my friends &#8212; and even their friends &#8212; to express themselves in ways they could not afford to anywhere else. Some played with poetry to various degrees of success, others cranked out opinion pieces, and some put together serial stories that remain some of the best writing I&#8217;ve read.

    This thing is really fun and useful. I made a Pummelvision based on my Flickr photos, which are admittedly not up-to-date (large chunk missing in the middle), but this was still spectacular to watch. Probably moreso for me than you, but still.

    Some things that pop into mind that I think fondly of, but don&#8217;t currently have&#8230;

**I miss driving**. Listening to music possibly too loud while on the way to work. Keeping up with the radio. Just generally controlling my own pace and being able to go beyond the city in which I live. I don&#8217;t miss having to find parking, though.

**I miss thunderstorms.** It rains here, but it&#8217;s that weird, unfulfilling, cold rain. Everyone uses umbrellas they don&#8217;t need and nearly poke out my eye as we pass on the sidewalk. And thunderstorms are just cool. I love watching it pour rain outside from under a porch roof in the summer. The smell. Lots of things.

**I miss hoagies**. You just can&#8217;t get the same thing here. And I want one. Often.

Sigh.

    Liz and I are on our way home for a vacation and visit with family. We haven&#8217;t had a length of time back east since Christmas, so we&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. It&#8217;d be a lie to say were haven&#8217;t been counting down the days for the past two weeks or so.

So you can imagine we were excited to finally be in the air and on our way this morning. We caught a cab at the crack of dawn (or just before ~5:30) this morning and were waiting for takeoff by five after seven. Certainly an early start for both of us. Well, to be accurate a late night for me, since I hadn&#8217;t (and still as of yet have not) slept. I got a new computer and was otherwise wired, so after packing I played on the computer until the wee hours of cab-time.

The flight was terrible. And that&#8217;s even before I consider that the flight didn&#8217;t even take us where we were supposed to go! I&#8217;m typing this entry from a terminal in a Detroit waiting to figure out when we&#8217;ll be back on our way to New Jersey. Sure, there&#8217;s some prickly weather out there, but it&#8217;s sunny here as I type this.

This is my first time in Detroit. I must say, Gate B5 is a charming site. And the moving walkway to my right is pretty exciting. All-in-all, there&#8217;s a lot to see in Detroit even within the fifty foot radius I&#8217;m allowed to stay while I wait for boarding updates.

Sigh.

Rumor has it they&#8217;re getting things together for us. Maybe we \*will\* eventually get home, after all!

Until next time, Detroit!

    I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is the place where your best dreams come true. If you want to sleep all day, you can. If you want to curl up and watch a movie on a cold, rainy day with your girlfriend and eat grilled cheese and tomato soup, you can. If you want to play Hungry Hungry Hippos or Candyland with your Mom and Dad, you can. If you want to meet some famous or amazing person or family member you never met in life and just hang out all day, you can.

You can do whatever you want. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy or perfect. It just has to be comfortable.

Looking back through some old [photos of my fabulous friend Leslie&#8217;s][1], I realized I&#8217;ve catalogued thoughts like this, before. Case in point: [Rockin&#8217; 305][2]. From early 2006:

[<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/132110261_df5f2f614c.jpg" alt="Rockin' 305" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="400" />][2]

And [my comment][3] below it:

> Dancin&#8217; it up in 305 with a hotdog in my mouth and friends by my side. A duplication of times like this would be a contender on my list of &#8220;things that occur with regularity in heaven.&#8221;

I still believe what I said. And looking through those pictures gave me serious pangs of homesickness.
