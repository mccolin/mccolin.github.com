    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was a time in my life when I wanted all of my breakfasts to be tasty treats. I went through the Lucky Charms phase (on several different occasions, actually), the Frosted Mini Wheats phase (during which I once exploded in anger like a brat to my Mom because she&#8217;d accidentally bought Frosted Wheat, not Frosted <em>Mini</em> Wheats), the many different varieties of Cheerios phase (including regular Cheerios covered in sugar I&#8217;d add every morning), and more. I was never into the over-the-top, clearly-only-candy-in-disguise cereals (though Cookie Crisp often mesmorized me with that awesome dog in all of their commercials), but I wanted the sweetness.</p>

<p>This love of sweet breakfast foods was combined during early high school years with a desire to combine things I liked into things I thought I&#8217;d really like. That&#8217;s when the madness was born. I wanted, once (just once, I swear) to figure out how to combine oat, potato, sour cream, and onion into a delicious cereal you could enjoy with milk.</p>

<p>Potato Chips? Good! Sour Cream and Onion Potato Chips? Even better! For breakfast!? Oh my god!</p>

<p>It was going to be like a Super Bowl party in your mouth every morning! Or at least that was what the commercials were going to say.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I never investigated the process or the combination of oats and flavorings, so there was never a prototype. Sometimes my mind wanders back to this potential invention and I want to try it&#8230; but then I think better of it.</p>

<p>But be warned if I ever ask you to try &#8220;this awesome new thing&#8221; for breakfast.</p>
