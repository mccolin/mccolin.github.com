  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&#8217;m afraid of this one prospect while at the same time being very excited by it. When I start to think deeply about it, I tense up and get crazy and can&#8217;t quite move or think straight. But I&#8217;m still excited about it&#8230; more than I have been of most things.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s not easy to deal with or process. Which got me to thinking about how many things I&#8217;ve done simply because it was exciting and how many things I haven&#8217;t done simply because it was frightening. I started thinking, also, about the outcomes of those things and wondering if the outcome was at all based on the preconceptions I had about it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s rarely a good idea to judge something before really getting to know it. I mean, some things are sure things to judge: a teddy bear will always be cuddly and fun, a war will always be gruesome and unnecessary. But <em>most</em> things shouldn&#8217;t be judged without making some attempt to understand or experience it for one&#8217;s self. And growing up is one of things you shouldn&#8217;t judge ahead of time, either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve thought many times how much <em>growing up sucks</em> or <em>I wish I was a kid again</em>. Those aren&#8217;t very brave ways to think about life. It&#8217;s like admitting you only want for yourself what you knew and not what may be new. It&#8217;s fearful thinking. If you continue thinking about how great the past was <em>without acknowledging your present or future</em>, you&#8217;re just succumbing to this fear and it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. You&#8217;re going to eventually realize that your childhood was much better than your adulthood, because you set yourself up to think only that way from the get-go.</p>

<p>So embrace things with excitement above fear. Be <em>cautious</em>. Don&#8217;t be <em>fearful</em>. If you are excited about your life, you will find the excitement you seek. It&#8217;s really that simple. It may not be that simple to build up that excitement, so it&#8217;s not <em>easy</em>, but once you&#8217;re on that path to being more excited about your present and your future, you&#8217;ll start to be excited when you think about yourself.</p>

<p>This is <em>why</em> life was so much better for most of us when we were young. We thought everything was a new adventure or journey and we didn&#8217;t know what there was out there to be afraid of, so we didn&#8217;t bother. Every day was another opportunity.</p>

<p>So start thinking that way again. And get excited.</p>
