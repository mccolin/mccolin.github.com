  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There was a time in my life when I wanted all of my breakfasts to be tasty treats. I went through the Lucky Charms phase (on several different occasions, actually), the Frosted Mini Wheats phase (during which I once exploded in anger like a brat to my Mom because she&#8217;d accidentally bought Frosted Wheat, not Frosted <em>Mini</em> Wheats), the many different varieties of Cheerios phase (including regular Cheerios covered in sugar I&#8217;d add every morning), and more. I was never into the over-the-top, clearly-only-candy-in-disguise cereals (though Cookie Crisp often mesmorized me with that awesome dog in all of their commercials), but I wanted the sweetness.</p>

<p>This love of sweet breakfast foods was combined during early high school years with a desire to combine things I liked into things I thought I&#8217;d really like. That&#8217;s when the madness was born. I wanted, once (just once, I swear) to figure out how to combine oat, potato, sour cream, and onion into a delicious cereal you could enjoy with milk.</p>

<p>Potato Chips? Good! Sour Cream and Onion Potato Chips? Even better! For breakfast!? Oh my god!</p>

<p>It was going to be like a Super Bowl party in your mouth every morning! Or at least that was what the commercials were going to say.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I never investigated the process or the combination of oats and flavorings, so there was never a prototype. Sometimes my mind wanders back to this potential invention and I want to try it&#8230; but then I think better of it.</p>

<p>But be warned if I ever ask you to try &#8220;this awesome new thing&#8221; for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is a place where you have as much time to finish projects you start as you need. There, you feel the adequate amount of pressure required to pull off your projects: never so much as to drive you away and never so little as to let you take forever to finish.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be free to try new things without feeling silly, unless &#8211; of course &#8211; you like feeling silly when you try new things.</p>

<p>Nothing that should be difficult would be easy, but nothing that should be easy would be difficult. Unless there&#8217;s still something to learn from it. Then it can be somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>In heaven, I don&#8217;t think there are any heating bills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When new people join an organization, company, or group of people, it is the job of the existing folks to bring that new person up-to-speed. During this process, the old-timer has a choice to make regarding their attitude in this indoctrination:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;I love it here and everything is awesome&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Things here are cool, but here&#8217;s some sour points&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This place sucks&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>When I&#8217;m the old-timer in a scenario like this, I tend to always fall into the second group of people. Why!?</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to even matter how I actually feel. If I&#8217;m more honestly in the first or third category, I still pull myself into this category that has mastered the soft touch. I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m putting myself in the new person&#8217;s shoes, because I&#8217;m reevaluating my own personal thinking, or something else.</p>

<p>In a job interview, if someone asks a question such as &#8220;what is the typical project life-cycle like around here?&#8221; &#8212; a very excellent question for an interviewing developer &#8212; I tend to answer at length rather than quickly. &#8220;Typically, the turnover is pretty quick. But some projects can run long because of client delays. It&#8217;s like this one project I&#8217;m on&#8230;. or this other one I&#8217;m working through&#8230;. or this one we had a couple months back&#8230;. yadda yadda&#8230;.&#8221; At a time when I should be upselling and singing the praises of our lifecycle I tend to fall back into this reality-stricken middleground.</p>

<p>This is even true of when I&#8217;m the new guy, too. I always straddle this in-between spot of not getting my expectations up or holding back in my degree of excitement. This has been very noticeable in the past few months as I&#8217;ve met new people and explore new things in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I want to be cordial and friendly and interested, and I temper my highs and lows in order to do this. Maybe this makes me more accurate on the overall. Or maybe this just makes me boring.</p>

    <p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve had the pleasure recently of ticketing your friends, skirting the law, and earning new cars and badges in <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/parkingwars/" title="Parking Wars by A&amp;E">Parking Wars</a> for a bit of time, now. <em>For the record: I&#8217;m nearing $750,000 in the app and am fending off charges from friends of lesser value while trying to climb ever-closer to friends that have more bank.</em> It&#8217;s addictive, this game!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why it was fun to see this when I tried to park my cars a bit, just now:</p>

<p><a href="http://mccolin.com/2008/04/02/its-a-war-out-there/parking-wars-is-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-19" title="Parking Wars is Down"></a></p>

  <a href="http://mccolin.com/2008/04/02/its-a-war-out-there/parking-wars-is-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-19" title="Parking Wars is Down"><img src="http://colinmccloskey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/pwars_update.thumbnail.png" alt="Parking Wars is Down" border="0" vspace="10" /></a>
</p>


<p>It was maddening, to me, to not be able to move and shift fake cars around on fake streets run virtually by my real friends.</p>

<p>*(All usage figures used below from <a href="http://www.adonomics.com/" title="Facebook application valuation and tracking statistics">Adonomics</a> reports, April 2, 2008) *</p>

<p>When a social networking application can become this addictive and enticing, it&#8217;s a seriously great score. It&#8217;s impressive. There have been studies that say an application &#8212; game or otherwise useful utility &#8212; has somewhere between 30 seconds and one minute to impress (or annoy!) the average Facebook user before they decide to uninstall the application. As most of these applications are attempting to leverage some sort of advertising angle, it&#8217;s a very make-or-break medium.</p>

<p>While I can&#8217;t confirm with numbers that A&amp;E is seeing an uptick in website traffic or viewership for the television program the game is modeled after, I can confirm with numbers that the application itself is proving to be one of the most engaging and actively-used applications in the Facebook realm:</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  Over 90 thousand people use Parking Wars every day. That&#8217;s nearly one-third of all of the 300 thousand plus people that currently have it installed. Somehow, in this realm of shortened attention spans, the folks behind Parking Wars have found a way to get one in every three of their users to return every day!
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  That&#8217;s unheard of. Well, not entirely. Let me give you an idea of how Parking Wars compares to some of the other top applications on Facebook: it ranks #64 in daily engagement (that one-third of people come back every day makes for a very high ranking) and is #498 in total installed user base.
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  While being barely in the top 500 might seem unimpressive, you should realize that being #498 out of #21,848 is a big feat. It&#8217;s right above &#8220;Are You A Bitch,&#8221; right behind &#8220;Which Hollywood Superstar Are You?&#8221; and interestingly close to an application my company has developed &#8211; <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/smartypants/" title="Smarty Pants for Facebook">Smarty Pants</a> (which sits at #518 with 285,000 total users, 8,550 of which come back every day).
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  As companies, advertising agencies, and marketing folk attempt to get a handle on how powerful social networking can be, they should observe applications like Parking Wars. There&#8217;s interesting pulls that keep users checking daily, whether it be defending themselves from ticket-happy friends, attempting to get the most money for their actions (it&#8217;s all virtual dollars, sadly), or just going in a punishing their friends for parking a black car in a yellow cars only zone.
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
   If Parking Wars doesn&#8217;t quite end up driving viewership to their television programming, it at least will go a great distance toward improving their brand image and introducing the A&E brand to the younger demographic available of Facebook. Perhaps in the near future they can find even better ways to pull people like me out of their daily routine to check a social networking application every so often. Good work if they manage it!
