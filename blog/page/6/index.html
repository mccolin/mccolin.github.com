    <p>I love dogs. They are both special and awesome. Now, I hate most email forwards, but my aunt sent me a particularly nice one that made me happy, so I figured I&#8217;d post it here:</p>

<p><strong>A Dog&rsquo;s Purpose</strong></p>

<p>Being a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog&#8217;s owners, Ron, his wife Lisa, and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.</p>

<p>I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn&#8217;t do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.</p>

    <p>There was a time in my life when I wanted all of my breakfasts to be tasty treats. I went through the Lucky Charms phase (on several different occasions, actually), the Frosted Mini Wheats phase (during which I once exploded in anger like a brat to my Mom because she&#8217;d accidentally bought Frosted Wheat, not Frosted <em>Mini</em> Wheats), the many different varieties of Cheerios phase (including regular Cheerios covered in sugar I&#8217;d add every morning), and more. I was never into the over-the-top, clearly-only-candy-in-disguise cereals (though Cookie Crisp often mesmorized me with that awesome dog in all of their commercials), but I wanted the sweetness.</p>

<p>This love of sweet breakfast foods was combined during early high school years with a desire to combine things I liked into things I thought I&#8217;d really like. That&#8217;s when the madness was born. I wanted, once (just once, I swear) to figure out how to combine oat, potato, sour cream, and onion into a delicious cereal you could enjoy with milk.</p>

<p>Potato Chips? Good! Sour Cream and Onion Potato Chips? Even better! For breakfast!? Oh my god!</p>

<p>It was going to be like a Super Bowl party in your mouth every morning! Or at least that was what the commercials were going to say.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I never investigated the process or the combination of oats and flavorings, so there was never a prototype. Sometimes my mind wanders back to this potential invention and I want to try it&#8230; but then I think better of it.</p>

<p>But be warned if I ever ask you to try &#8220;this awesome new thing&#8221; for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is a place where you have as much time to finish projects you start as you need. There, you feel the adequate amount of pressure required to pull off your projects: never so much as to drive you away and never so little as to let you take forever to finish.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be free to try new things without feeling silly, unless &#8211; of course &#8211; you like feeling silly when you try new things.</p>

<p>Nothing that should be difficult would be easy, but nothing that should be easy would be difficult. Unless there&#8217;s still something to learn from it. Then it can be somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>In heaven, I don&#8217;t think there are any heating bills.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When new people join an organization, company, or group of people, it is the job of the existing folks to bring that new person up-to-speed. During this process, the old-timer has a choice to make regarding their attitude in this indoctrination:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;I love it here and everything is awesome&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Things here are cool, but here&#8217;s some sour points&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;This place sucks&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>When I&#8217;m the old-timer in a scenario like this, I tend to always fall into the second group of people. Why!?</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to even matter how I actually feel. If I&#8217;m more honestly in the first or third category, I still pull myself into this category that has mastered the soft touch. I don&#8217;t know if this is because I&#8217;m putting myself in the new person&#8217;s shoes, because I&#8217;m reevaluating my own personal thinking, or something else.</p>

<p>In a job interview, if someone asks a question such as &#8220;what is the typical project life-cycle like around here?&#8221; &#8212; a very excellent question for an interviewing developer &#8212; I tend to answer at length rather than quickly. &#8220;Typically, the turnover is pretty quick. But some projects can run long because of client delays. It&#8217;s like this one project I&#8217;m on&#8230;. or this other one I&#8217;m working through&#8230;. or this one we had a couple months back&#8230;. yadda yadda&#8230;.&#8221; At a time when I should be upselling and singing the praises of our lifecycle I tend to fall back into this reality-stricken middleground.</p>

<p>This is even true of when I&#8217;m the new guy, too. I always straddle this in-between spot of not getting my expectations up or holding back in my degree of excitement. This has been very noticeable in the past few months as I&#8217;ve met new people and explore new things in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I want to be cordial and friendly and interested, and I temper my highs and lows in order to do this. Maybe this makes me more accurate on the overall. Or maybe this just makes me boring.</p>
