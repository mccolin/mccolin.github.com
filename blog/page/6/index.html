    <p>Liz and I are on our way home for a vacation and visit with family. We haven&#8217;t had a length of time back east since Christmas, so we&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. It&#8217;d be a lie to say were haven&#8217;t been counting down the days for the past two weeks or so.</p>

<p>So you can imagine we were excited to finally be in the air and on our way this morning. We caught a cab at the crack of dawn (or just before ~5:30) this morning and were waiting for takeoff by five after seven. Certainly an early start for both of us. Well, to be accurate a late night for me, since I hadn&#8217;t (and still as of yet have not) slept. I got a new computer and was otherwise wired, so after packing I played on the computer until the wee hours of cab-time.</p>

<p>The flight was terrible. And that&#8217;s even before I consider that the flight didn&#8217;t even take us where we were supposed to go! I&#8217;m typing this entry from a terminal in a Detroit waiting to figure out when we&#8217;ll be back on our way to New Jersey. Sure, there&#8217;s some prickly weather out there, but it&#8217;s sunny here as I type this.</p>

<p>This is my first time in Detroit. I must say, Gate B5 is a charming site. And the moving walkway to my right is pretty exciting. All-in-all, there&#8217;s a lot to see in Detroit even within the fifty foot radius I&#8217;m allowed to stay while I wait for boarding updates.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Rumor has it they&#8217;re getting things together for us. Maybe we *will* eventually get home, after all!</p>

<p>Until next time, Detroit!</p>

    <p>I love dogs. They are both special and awesome. Now, I hate most email forwards, but my aunt sent me a particularly nice one that made me happy, so I figured I&#8217;d post it here:</p>

<p><strong>A Dog&rsquo;s Purpose</strong></p>

<p>Being a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog&#8217;s owners, Ron, his wife Lisa, and their little boy Shane, were all very attached to Belker, and they were hoping for a miracle.</p>

<p>I examined Belker and found he was dying of cancer. I told the family we couldn&#8217;t do anything for Belker, and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.</p>

    <p>There was a time in my life when I wanted all of my breakfasts to be tasty treats. I went through the Lucky Charms phase (on several different occasions, actually), the Frosted Mini Wheats phase (during which I once exploded in anger like a brat to my Mom because she&#8217;d accidentally bought Frosted Wheat, not Frosted <em>Mini</em> Wheats), the many different varieties of Cheerios phase (including regular Cheerios covered in sugar I&#8217;d add every morning), and more. I was never into the over-the-top, clearly-only-candy-in-disguise cereals (though Cookie Crisp often mesmorized me with that awesome dog in all of their commercials), but I wanted the sweetness.</p>

<p>This love of sweet breakfast foods was combined during early high school years with a desire to combine things I liked into things I thought I&#8217;d really like. That&#8217;s when the madness was born. I wanted, once (just once, I swear) to figure out how to combine oat, potato, sour cream, and onion into a delicious cereal you could enjoy with milk.</p>

<p>Potato Chips? Good! Sour Cream and Onion Potato Chips? Even better! For breakfast!? Oh my god!</p>

<p>It was going to be like a Super Bowl party in your mouth every morning! Or at least that was what the commercials were going to say.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I never investigated the process or the combination of oats and flavorings, so there was never a prototype. Sometimes my mind wanders back to this potential invention and I want to try it&#8230; but then I think better of it.</p>

<p>But be warned if I ever ask you to try &#8220;this awesome new thing&#8221; for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is a place where you have as much time to finish projects you start as you need. There, you feel the adequate amount of pressure required to pull off your projects: never so much as to drive you away and never so little as to let you take forever to finish.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be free to try new things without feeling silly, unless &#8211; of course &#8211; you like feeling silly when you try new things.</p>

<p>Nothing that should be difficult would be easy, but nothing that should be easy would be difficult. Unless there&#8217;s still something to learn from it. Then it can be somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>In heaven, I don&#8217;t think there are any heating bills.</p>
