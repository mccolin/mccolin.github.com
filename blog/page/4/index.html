<p>Or bird, rather. This is Pepper, Liz&#8217; Mom&#8217;s bird. Pepper is very pretty (she even acknowledges this by saying &#8220;Pretty Birdy&#8221; often) and is kind of cute. And then you get near her and she becomes quite the pest.</p>

<p>You see, Pepper is pretty spoiled. She gets to do what she wants and most of the time she gets to do it when she wants. When her Mommy went out of town, however, on a recent vacation, most of the bird-sitting duties fell to&#8230; me&#8230; the stranger with the beard.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t take to me right away. Oh sure, I&#8217;d occasionally bring her over to the garbage can so she could poop away from her cage. And I&#8217;d occasionally make some sounds that she could respond to. But sometimes I&#8217;d forget to leave her music on. Or I&#8217;d not get downstairs early enough in the morning to let her out. Or I&#8217;d yell at her for squawking so loudly in my ear. It wasn&#8217;t her ideal arrangement. After all, where was her Mommy? Who is this guy?</p>

<p>But a funny thing happened halfway through her second day being stuck with me. She started to like me. She started to like me so much, in fact, that she wouldn&#8217;t leave me alone. She demanded that I let her sit on my shoulder. She chirped and cooed at me and rubbed her beak on me playfully. She cried when I left the room. She wouldn&#8217;t let me take her off of my shoulder. She was generally sick without me nearby.</p>

<p>And I finally understood. If you&#8217;re nice (enough) to the bird, she&#8217;ll come to accept you. And while I was nowhere near as cool as her Mommy, I was better than nobody. A lot better than nobody. So she clutched to me fiercely.</p>

<p>It all worked itself out. A vacation in Miami can last only so long and when it was over, Pepper&#8217;s Mommy returned. She has since calmed down considerably. Oh sure, I&#8217;m not really important to her, anymore, because her mom&#8217;s back, and I&#8217;m more comfortable *not* having a bird all over me half the time&#8230; but we&#8217;ll always have those four or so days.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll always have that.</p>

    <p>My friends Jess and Dana have been embarking on a journey to photograph themselves with every statue of the Phillie Phanatic that has been across Philadelphia in the recent &#8220;Phanatic About Town&#8221; promotion. Local artists put their own spin on the Phanatic by building themed statues of him. The statues were placed in different locations in the city, and are actually now up for auction.</p>

<p>Jess and Dana wanted a photo of themselves with every Phanatic statue. And, as luck would have it, the Phillies held an event at Citizens Bank Park this past weekend where you could get next to every one of the statues. It&#8217;s kind of cheating, but it works. I helped them take the pictures at the park! And I had a hot dog! It was great!</p>

  <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>About ten years ago, probably, it would be a semi-frequent pastime of me and some of my geekier friends to get together in one another&#8217;s basements, connect our computers via a series of wires, gadgets, and switches. You see, wireless networks were not prevalent (or inexpensive) at the time, so it would take about an hour or more to get all set up. Once we finally got it altogether, we&#8217;d play a few first person shooter games, sports games, etc., drink lots of soda, and generally geek out until morning.</p>

<p>Some of the games were not of my most interest, however. Back at home, my parents did not have fast Internet (like that of many of my friends), so what I would spend a big portion of my time doing, is searching through my friends&#8217; computers for MP3&#8242;s, videos, and other interesting files, copying them over to my machine if I found them particularly interesting.</p>

<p>My friend Drew had a large collection of MP3&#8242;s that were of interest to me: Nirvana&#8217;s entire catalog, various Incubus archives, other bands I enjoyed. So, without thinking twice, I copied everything he had that was interesting onto my own computer.</p>

<p>Thing is &#8212; these MP3&#8242;s of Drews are of a particularly low quality. MP3&#8242;s have a bit-rate, which essentially is a measure of how much information is contained in each second of music within the file. Naturally, the higher the bit-rate, the more information in the song, the larger the MP3 file. Keep in mind that this was circa 1999-2001, when hard disks didn&#8217;t come nearly as large as they do now, and didn&#8217;t come nearly as cheaply as they do, now, either.</p>

<p>CD-quality is essentially 128kbps (meaning 128 kilobits of information are contained in each second of music). Drew &#8212; who perhaps doesn&#8217;t possess &#8220;audiophile&#8221; level hearing &#8212; had made a decision to store all of his MP3s at 56kbps to save space (on his small, expensive hard drive). He saved space and the expense of reduced quality, which he couldn&#8217;t tell the difference. And to be fair, I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference too much, either.</p>

<p>But then speakers got better. And iPods came out. And headphones got better. And and and and&#8230; 56kbps MP3s that previously sounded adequate started to sound like absolute crap. Drums are tinny, vocals are scratchy, and the details are missing. They don&#8217;t take up much space, though.</p>

<p>So here it is 2010. Disk space is large and disk space is cheap. Speakers and headphones are of high quality. And I still have about 80 really, really low quality MP3s hanging around that have followed me from computer-to-computer-to-computer over the years.</p>

<p>These low-quality files come up occasionally when I&#8217;m on shuffle and at first I won&#8217;t notice. I&#8217;ll get into it. Then when that chorus hits and Dave Grohl&#8217;s drumming starts to sound like Doug Funnie banging on a trash can, I know.</p>

<p>Drew, your MP3 from ten years ago got me again!</p>

    <p>Getting a new business card has always been exciting to me. It&rsquo;s just a small piece of paper that I don&rsquo;t frequently give out, but it just feels great to have it in hand. It&rsquo;s like a validation.</p>

<p>Could&rsquo;ve used this before f8, but oh well.</p>

    <p>Some things that pop into mind that I think fondly of, but don&#8217;t currently have&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>I miss driving</strong>. Listening to music possibly too loud while on the way to work. Keeping up with the radio. Just generally controlling my own pace and being able to go beyond the city in which I live. I don&#8217;t miss having to find parking, though.</p>

<p><strong>I miss thunderstorms.</strong> It rains here, but it&#8217;s that weird, unfulfilling, cold rain. Everyone uses umbrellas they don&#8217;t need and nearly poke out my eye as we pass on the sidewalk. And thunderstorms are just cool. I love watching it pour rain outside from under a porch roof in the summer. The smell. Lots of things.</p>

<p><strong>I miss hoagies</strong>. You just can&#8217;t get the same thing here. And I want one. Often.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>
