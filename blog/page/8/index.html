    <p>Michele is a clairvoyant that I went to last night. Pam and Brian have gone to a weekly session he holds a few times, now, and invited me along. It was really incredible. He teaches for a little while about astrology and other different topics and at the end he reads the people in attendance &#8212; letting them ask questions about themselves, their future, whatever.</p>

<p>I was pretty nervous it being my first time and he started reading me right during his teaching lecture, because he recognized I was new. Maybe it was his way of proving to me that he does have an ability, maybe it&#8217;s something he does to new people to see them squirm a little, or maybe that&#8217;s just what seemed right for him to do at the time. It was ridiculous how accurate he was in describing me without having ever spoken to me before.</p>

<p>Some things he said about me when he called me out during his lecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>He is very introspective, his aura is concentrated around his head</li>
<li>Everything is intellectual, he thinks about everything</li>
<li>His aura is a dark grey color (this color aura may be why people refer to the &#8220;thinking&#8221; part of the brain as &#8220;grey matter&#8221;)</li>
<li>He is calculating and always compiling information</li>
<li>All energy is toward microcosmic worlds he creates that are perfect for him. He does not need other people to understand them</li>
<li>He is an Aquarius</li>
<li>He has sensitive knees; either an existing or future problem with his knees</li>
<li>He likes games and is always creating and improving games.</li>
<li>He often takes the root of a game and expands upon it, always fixing it.</li>
<li>Some ideas about his games and projects he keeps as personal trade secrets</li>
<li>He does not like to go ahead with things until the concept is perfectly set in his mind</li>
<li>He will have quick bursts and lulls in work because of this</li>
<li>He creates very animated worlds in his head, he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;care much for the outside world&#8221;</li>
<li>He is aggressive, animated, and edgy</li>
</ul>


<p>He asked if I had any questions. Being a deer-in-headlights sort of, I only thought to ask one. I asked if my upcoming trip to San Francisco would be a good one:</p>

<ul>
<li>It took you to long to make plans for this trip, so it better be good!</li>
<li>You didn&#8217;t make the decision yourself, you were surprised and maybe pushed to do it.</li>
<li>You will meet very interesting people and it will be competitive, all about &#8220;who is better than me?&#8221;</li>
<li>My guide seems to think it will be &#8220;old San Francisco, not new&#8221;</li>
<li>This is in two weeks, yes? (yes, roughly)</li>
<li>You will get many ideas that will enhance your creativity</li>
<li>It will be a very good trip, have a great time.</li>
<li>This place is your Mecca</li>
</ul>


<p>Kind of rad.</p>

<p>At the end of the session, he goes around and reads each of us. He consults with his guide and tells you what he sees. You can ask questions of him afterward, but I was too chicken to ask some of the things I wanted. He probably knew this. Here are the things he told me:</p>

<ul>
<li>In two years, you will leave New Jersey to live in another part of the country</li>
<li>You will do this to flee people. You can be antisocial at times.</li>
<li>There will be some feelings of revulsion towards people that you will have and you will leave to reconnect with your self</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve been over-thinking things and splitting hairs since you were around seventeen</li>
<li>Some split in your family accentuated this when you were nineteen

<ul>
<li><em>Note: I wasn&#8217;t sure what he was talking about, so he tried to be specific:</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It was when you were nineteen, say January 29th.</li>
<li>You cannot stay in one place for too long. You will do a lot of jobs, some you may have no idea about, now.</li>
<li>You are a perfectionist.</li>
<li>Around age 30-31 &#8212; probably 30 &#8212; you will become more stable and maybe settle down</li>
</ul>


<p>Brian&#8217;s notes also have the final line &#8220;It&#8217;s not a comp,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure if that word expands to &#8220;computer,&#8221; &#8220;competition,&#8221; or something else.</p>

<p>I have some personal-history research to do, because I&#8217;m not sure about everything, but based on his initial reading of me and its crazy kind of accuracy, I&#8217;m willing to bet he knows some things I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Crazy.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m afraid of this one prospect while at the same time being very excited by it. When I start to think deeply about it, I tense up and get crazy and can&#8217;t quite move or think straight. But I&#8217;m still excited about it&#8230; more than I have been of most things.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s not easy to deal with or process. Which got me to thinking about how many things I&#8217;ve done simply because it was exciting and how many things I haven&#8217;t done simply because it was frightening. I started thinking, also, about the outcomes of those things and wondering if the outcome was at all based on the preconceptions I had about it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s rarely a good idea to judge something before really getting to know it. I mean, some things are sure things to judge: a teddy bear will always be cuddly and fun, a war will always be gruesome and unnecessary. But <em>most</em> things shouldn&#8217;t be judged without making some attempt to understand or experience it for one&#8217;s self. And growing up is one of things you shouldn&#8217;t judge ahead of time, either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve thought many times how much <em>growing up sucks</em> or <em>I wish I was a kid again</em>. Those aren&#8217;t very brave ways to think about life. It&#8217;s like admitting you only want for yourself what you knew and not what may be new. It&#8217;s fearful thinking. If you continue thinking about how great the past was <em>without acknowledging your present or future</em>, you&#8217;re just succumbing to this fear and it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. You&#8217;re going to eventually realize that your childhood was much better than your adulthood, because you set yourself up to think only that way from the get-go.</p>

<p>So embrace things with excitement above fear. Be <em>cautious</em>. Don&#8217;t be <em>fearful</em>. If you are excited about your life, you will find the excitement you seek. It&#8217;s really that simple. It may not be that simple to build up that excitement, so it&#8217;s not <em>easy</em>, but once you&#8217;re on that path to being more excited about your present and your future, you&#8217;ll start to be excited when you think about yourself.</p>

<p>This is <em>why</em> life was so much better for most of us when we were young. We thought everything was a new adventure or journey and we didn&#8217;t know what there was out there to be afraid of, so we didn&#8217;t bother. Every day was another opportunity.</p>

<p>So start thinking that way again. And get excited.</p>

    <p><em>Warning: Ideas expressed a million times over by a million other people appear on in this post!</em></p>

<p>This is a very weird age to be. By that I mean that being post-college, pre-family (or pre-life, really) is a weird place to be. We&#8217;ve spent all of this time being told we should go to school for education and experience to prepare us for life and while it has helped prepare us in so many ways, there&#8217;s no real way to prepare for the void many people find themselves in post-college, pre-life. I said pre-family before, because I suppose that&#8217;s what I think I&#8217;d like to get to, but it&#8217;s not everyone&#8217;s bag, so whatev.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that weirdness, though, that I&#8217;ve been feeling and writing a lot about, lately. There&#8217;s this urge I have to go do something totally great and unexpected and wild, but there&#8217;s this tether inside me that wants to avoid rocking the boat or straying from this course I&#8217;ve been set on my entire life. The real glitch is that I&#8217;m realizing more and more these days that course is all unchartered for the time and place in my life where I currently am. So it goes.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where life takes over in most incredible stories and that&#8217;s where I have to allow it to take over by trying new things and exploring my desires without the tether, I think. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the mentality that&#8217;s been going into things like &#8220;<a href="http://colinmccloskey.com/blog/2007/11/05/i-dont-have-friends/" title="Blog entry: I Don't Have Friends">I Don&#8217;t Have Friends</a>.&#8221; Some mentality where I&#8217;m realizing it&#8217;s okay to not be happy all of the time, so long as you realize it and personally enact some change to improve that state.</p>

<p>Having <em>something </em>exciting going in one&#8217;s life can go a long way towards this cause. What I need to do is find some thing, some place, or some person in my life that will make days exciting &#8212; or at least keep me going. It&#8217;s not all on that thing, place, or person, not at all. It&#8217;s more on me to find and nurture whatever it is I find that keeps me excited so I can keep going.</p>

<p>And that, my friends, is life. Fickle broad.</p>

    <p>Converting potential energy into kinetic energy happens all of the time. You roll a ball down a hill. You knock something off of a table. You tap your foot. It&#8217;s easy.</p>

<p>So why, then, is it so difficult to turn inspiration into action? If you think about it, inspiration is the potential for some action. An idea strikes you and then you set out about turning that idea into something concrete.</p>

<p>Lately, I seem to be able to get things out of my head and onto paper, but never beyond that. I can&#8217;t make a song into music. I can&#8217;t make a design into a website. I can&#8217;t seem to dedicate myself to the real work. I&#8217;m not lazy. I&#8217;m tired. And, yes, there&#8217;s a difference. Being tired comes from exhaustion, stress, the fact that I have to spend eight hours of my day working on other ideas that aren&#8217;t always mine so I can provide for myself and make a living. It all leaves me exhausted and unable or sometimes unwilling to really work on my own ideas.</p>

<p>Where do the great innovators find the time? Do they neglect their work, families, and friends? Do they live with nothing while they devote themselves to their next-big-something?</p>

<p>If that&#8217;s what it takes, why can&#8217;t I find the courage within myself to set out and attempt it? Forgo the typicalities of the &#8220;real&#8221; world while I work on my masterpiece?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>But I do.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid to.</p>

<p>Or I&#8217;m too busy thinking about how it must not be necessary to make such great sacrifices just to begin a search for success. Sure, to eventually make something of myself, I&#8217;ll have to sacrifice some big things along the way, but right from the get go? Funny. Because all of the time I&#8217;m wasting worrying and thinking about it is being spent by other, more fastidious and more brilliant people to get where they want to be headed.</p>

<p>Shit.</p>
