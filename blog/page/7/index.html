    <p>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve had the pleasure recently of ticketing your friends, skirting the law, and earning new cars and badges in <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/parkingwars/" title="Parking Wars by A&amp;E">Parking Wars</a> for a bit of time, now. <em>For the record: I&#8217;m nearing $750,000 in the app and am fending off charges from friends of lesser value while trying to climb ever-closer to friends that have more bank.</em> It&#8217;s addictive, this game!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why it was fun to see this when I tried to park my cars a bit, just now:</p>

<p><a href="http://mccolin.com/2008/04/02/its-a-war-out-there/parking-wars-is-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-19" title="Parking Wars is Down"></a></p>

  <a href="http://mccolin.com/2008/04/02/its-a-war-out-there/parking-wars-is-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-19" title="Parking Wars is Down"><img src="http://colinmccloskey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/pwars_update.thumbnail.png" alt="Parking Wars is Down" border="0" vspace="10" /></a>
</p>


<p>It was maddening, to me, to not be able to move and shift fake cars around on fake streets run virtually by my real friends.</p>

<p>*(All usage figures used below from <a href="http://www.adonomics.com/" title="Facebook application valuation and tracking statistics">Adonomics</a> reports, April 2, 2008) *</p>

<p>When a social networking application can become this addictive and enticing, it&#8217;s a seriously great score. It&#8217;s impressive. There have been studies that say an application &#8212; game or otherwise useful utility &#8212; has somewhere between 30 seconds and one minute to impress (or annoy!) the average Facebook user before they decide to uninstall the application. As most of these applications are attempting to leverage some sort of advertising angle, it&#8217;s a very make-or-break medium.</p>

<p>While I can&#8217;t confirm with numbers that A&amp;E is seeing an uptick in website traffic or viewership for the television program the game is modeled after, I can confirm with numbers that the application itself is proving to be one of the most engaging and actively-used applications in the Facebook realm:</p>

<p class="dataRight">
  Over 90 thousand people use Parking Wars every day. That&#8217;s nearly one-third of all of the 300 thousand plus people that currently have it installed. Somehow, in this realm of shortened attention spans, the folks behind Parking Wars have found a way to get one in every three of their users to return every day!
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  That&#8217;s unheard of. Well, not entirely. Let me give you an idea of how Parking Wars compares to some of the other top applications on Facebook: it ranks #64 in daily engagement (that one-third of people come back every day makes for a very high ranking) and is #498 in total installed user base.
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  While being barely in the top 500 might seem unimpressive, you should realize that being #498 out of #21,848 is a big feat. It&#8217;s right above &#8220;Are You A Bitch,&#8221; right behind &#8220;Which Hollywood Superstar Are You?&#8221; and interestingly close to an application my company has developed &#8211; <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/smartypants/" title="Smarty Pants for Facebook">Smarty Pants</a> (which sits at #518 with 285,000 total users, 8,550 of which come back every day).
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
  As companies, advertising agencies, and marketing folk attempt to get a handle on how powerful social networking can be, they should observe applications like Parking Wars. There&#8217;s interesting pulls that keep users checking daily, whether it be defending themselves from ticket-happy friends, attempting to get the most money for their actions (it&#8217;s all virtual dollars, sadly), or just going in a punishing their friends for parking a black car in a yellow cars only zone.
</p>




<p class="dataRight">
   If Parking Wars doesn&#8217;t quite end up driving viewership to their television programming, it at least will go a great distance toward improving their brand image and introducing the A&E brand to the younger demographic available of Facebook. Perhaps in the near future they can find even better ways to pull people like me out of their daily routine to check a social networking application every so often. Good work if they manage it!

    <p>I&#8217;d like to think that heaven is the place where your best dreams come true. If you want to sleep all day, you can. If you want to curl up and watch a movie on a cold, rainy day with your girlfriend and eat grilled cheese and tomato soup, you can. If you want to play Hungry Hungry Hippos or Candyland with your Mom and Dad, you can. If you want to meet some famous or amazing person or family member you never met in life and just hang out all day, you can.</p>

<p>You can do whatever you want. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fancy or perfect. It just has to be comfortable.</p>

<p>Looking back through some old <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leslieanneforsyth/sets/72057594112606079/" title="Dollar Dogs">photos of my fabulous friend Leslie&#8217;s</a>, I realized I&#8217;ve catalogued thoughts like this, before. Case in point: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leslieanneforsyth/132110261/in/set-72057594112606079/" title="Rockin' 305">Rockin&#8217; 305</a>. From early 2006:</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leslieanneforsyth/132110261/in/set-72057594112606079/" title="Rockin' 305"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/132110261_df5f2f614c.jpg" alt="Rockin' 305" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="400" /></a></p>

<p>And <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/leslieanneforsyth/132110261/#comment72157594170112137">my comment</a> below it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dancin&#8217; it up in 305 with a hotdog in my mouth and friends by my side. A duplication of times like this would be a contender on my list of &#8220;things that occur with regularity in heaven.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I still believe what I said. And looking through those pictures gave me serious pangs of homesickness.</p>

    <p>Living on my own in a house with a few other people you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have all sorts of opportunities to cook and prepare food and learn the ins and outs of the kitchen. Preparing new dishes and making old favorites would become a daily happening, yes? No. I tend to work fairly long hours, grab a bite to eat when I can on my way to or from somewhere else, or whip up something that&#8217;s tried and true &#8212; and pretty standard. Occasionally I stray from old standbys by mixing elements of a few together to make something delicious. Here&#8217;s my first foray.</p>

<p>Now this is not groundbreaking stuff. I&#8217;m probably somewhere between the fourteenth and four-hundred-thousandth person to think this one up, but here&#8217;s how I went about it.</p>

<p><strong>Cheesy Hot Dog Scramble</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients</p>

<ul>
<li>2 Hot Dogs</li>
<li>4 to Six Eggs</li>
<li>Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese</li>
<li>Fresh Ground Pepper</li>
<li>&frac12; Tbsp Butter</li>
</ul>


<p>Preparation</p>

<ol>
<li>Cut the hot dogs into small pieces (as you would for a wee tot) while sizzling the butter to a melt in a frying pan.</li>
<li>Fry up the hot dog bits on the frying pan, flipping them often enough to prevent burning</li>
<li>While frying up the hot dog bits, whisk four eggs with ground pepper and shredded cheese in a small bowl</li>
<li>Remove the hot dogs from the frying pan, <em>leaving the resulting grease in the pan</em>.</li>
<li>Pour the whisked eggs, pepper, and cheese into the pan and prepare as scrambled</li>
<li>When the eggs have coagulated enough, add the hot dog bits and mix all together.</li>
</ol>


<p>Serves two. Delicious on a toasted sandwich or by its lonesome!</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s been almost two weeks since I made the move from New Jersey to San Francisco. About thirteen days. Some moments it feels like it&#8217;s been longer and other times it feels like it&#8217;s been no time at all, though admittedly more of the former than the latter.</p>

<p>Now, enough time hasn&#8217;t elapsed where I&#8217;d be able to make sweeping statements of &#8220;west coast attitude vs. east coast attitude&#8221; or anything remotely similar. That&#8217;s not something one can qualify in this short period of time. So much goes into making quality statements like that. Is it a city versus suburbs difference? Is it a California versus New Jersey difference? Is it a hipster versus sub-metro difference? Is it something else? Is it just the ridiculous differences in weather, perhaps!?</p>

<p>What I have learned from my time in this city is that there are many friendly people willing to meet a new face, chat with them, show them around, and have a good time with them. I&#8217;ve met a decently large amount of people in my short time out here, largely in part to the welcoming ways ways of my new housemates and co-workers. Whether or not the welcoming attitude is a personality trait inherent to these fine people or inherent to the region from which they come is something I can&#8217;t determine. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s the people.</p>

<p>If you have an open mind and are willing to break &#8212; at least a bit &#8212; from any shell you might be in, moving to a city can be an invigorating experience. I still find myself being a bit hesitant to &#8220;jump in&#8221; in certain respects, but <em>far</em> less so than I thought I&#8217;d be. I&#8217;ve tried new things, changed my eating habits, learned and successfully navigated multiple types of public transportation, gone to several parties and outings, and done some exploring.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#8217;m still wrapped up in a personal cocoon a bit, but it&#8217;s nothing major.  It&#8217;s important to me to maintain my sense of self while learning, experiencing, and taking new aspects for that self. As long as I&#8217;m doing things because I truly want to attempt them or learn about them and not because I feel a social pretext or need to, I will be happy with myself. And, thankfully, there are tons of ways to do that in this new locale.</p>

<p>Work is so far very good. I enjoy the company of my colleagues and feel we are doing well meeting each other. The job is fun and exciting and entails work with technologies I am excited about daily. It is thrilling to work for a variety of clients and brands in the span of a week and to have my work be touched by end users thousands of times over. That I get to balance significant amounts of technical <em>and</em> creative skills in my work is something I&#8217;m very glad about.</p>

<p>Home is becoming more so in rapid chunks of time. It&#8217;s difficult to be engaging and full of energy each day after work, but the relationships I&#8217;m building with housemates and friends are already becoming rewarding and fun. I am comfortable and much sooner than I&#8217;d anticipated. The tiny barriers that exist are all from my own personal end and are sure to be down before long. That, and, getting furniture in my room would go a great distance to making me physically &#8220;set.&#8221;</p>

<p>Missing home is pretty much as I&#8217;d anticipated: it sucks. So many people back home have been very curious about the move and also understanding of any less-than-reasonable time it&#8217;s taken me to get back to them while I get settled. Don&#8217;t let anyone convince you that a three-hour time difference is no big deal &#8212; it is <em>significant</em>. Phone calls, emails, online chats, and any form of communication take on a different timing and sometimes have to juggle two independent contexts that can be so very frustrating. It&#8217;s really limiting and confining in a lot of respects, but I am finding adequate (not great, but adequate) ways around the limitations.</p>

<p>So, in summation: so far, so good. San Francisco has proven itself to be a beautiful, friendly, and fun place to live. Work is fun and challenging at the same time. People are thus far wonderful and welcoming.</p>

<p>I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m still on the way, but in reality I&#8217;m already here.</p>

    <p>*I found this in a stack of many things like it &#8212; songs that weren&#8217;t good enough to ever put music to. It&#8217;s from February 2005. I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;Believe Me,&#8221; now, but referred to it as &#8220;Overly Emo Love Song&#8221; at the time. *</p>

<p>I want to show you how much I love you<br/>
If it&#8217;s the only thing I ever do<br/>
If it&#8217;s what you needed to see it<br/>
I&#8217;d rip my heart out and serve it to you</p>

<p>Because life&#8217;s too short to be living in doubt<br/>
Whatever it takes to believe me is what I need now<br/>
So just tell me make me force me show me how<br/>
I can make you see</p>

<p>I can see it in your eyes<br/>
Like every time&#8217;s a surprise<br/>
I tell you that I need you<br/>
You consider it all lies</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the truth and that I know<br/>
So drop the caution and let&#8217;s just go<br/>
Believe me when I tell you truth<br/>
The thing I love most is you</p>

<p>If you want my heart on a platter<br/>
I&#8217;ll bring it to you  with a knife and spoon<br/>
Just on the hope you&#8217;ll believe me<br/>
More than once in a blue moon</p>

<p>Whatever you want me to do<br/>
Whatever you need me to say<br/>
Whatever it takes to convince you<br/>
I can make you see</p>

<p><em>Naturally, there&#8217;d be some differentiation between chorus, verses, and breaks. I don&#8217;t think my notes every got that far. It was really interesting to find this. And pretty exciting to tear up the paper it was written on.</em></p>
